## Guide for Pure Mathematics Learning

Research-level mathematicians at places like Princeton, ENS or MIT are expected to have a broad and deep foundation across all major pure-math fields. In **Algebra**, they know group theory (simple and finite groups, Sylow theorems, representation theory), ring and module theory, field extensions and Galois theory, category theory, homological algebra and basics of algebraic geometry. In **Number Theory**, they are familiar with divisibility, primes, Diophantine equations, algebraic and analytic methods (e.g. quadratic forms, reciprocity, L-functions, modular forms, elliptic curves). In **Geometry** (differential and algebraic), they know manifolds and curvature (Riemannian geometry, Lie groups), basics of symplectic topology, as well as varieties and schemes, sheaf cohomology and Hodge theory in algebraic geometry. In **Topology**, they have training in point-set topology (compactness, metric spaces) and algebraic topology (homotopy, homology, cohomology, fundamental groups, covering spaces), and often manifold topology (knot theory, characteristic classes, surgery, etc.). In **Analysis**, they master real and complex analysis (metric spaces, Lebesgue integration, analytic continuation, Riemann surfaces, etc.), functional analysis (Banach/Hilbert space theory, spectral theory), and partial differential equations/basic harmonic analysis. In **Logic and Foundations**, they know set theory (ZFC axioms, ordinals, cardinals), basic model theory and computability, and formal proof concepts. Many PhDs also study **Combinatorics** (graph theory, extremal methods, probabilistic combinatorics) and apply category-theoretic methods.

Across these areas, key **techniques** include: using group actions and cohomology in algebra; analytic continuation and contour integration in complex analysis; variational methods and Sobolev spaces in PDEs; simplicial and singular complexes in topology; sheaf-theoretic arguments in algebraic geometry; diagonalization and compact operators in functional analysis; model-theoretic methods and forcing in logic, etc. **Influential works** range from classical theorems (e.g. the Atiyah–Singer index theorem in geometry, Weil conjectures in algebraic geometry, Hardy–Littlewood’s work in analytic number theory, foundational set theory of Gödel and Cohen) to modern breakthroughs (Wiles’ proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem, Perelman’s solution of Poincaré, Langlands’s reciprocity conjectures, etc.). Each field also has famous open problems or conjectures: for example, the **Riemann Hypothesis** (number theory/complex analysis), the **Birch–Swinnerton–Dyer conjecture** (arithmetic geometry), the **Hodge conjecture** (algebraic geometry), **Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness** (PDEs), **continuum hypothesis** (set theory), and many others. (For a general survey of famous unsolved problems, see the Clay Mathematics Millennium Problem list.) In short, a top-tier pure-math PhD is expected to command the core definitions and theorems of each area, understand standard proof methods (e.g. induction and extremal arguments in combinatorics, Fourier and analytic methods in analysis, spectral sequences and category theory in topology, etc.), and be aware of the main conjectures and landmarks in each field.

#### Traits and Habits of a Research Mathematician

Successful research mathematicians share a blend of intellectual abilities and personal habits. **Problem-solving ability and creativity** are central: modern commentary emphasizes that “the creative aspect of mathematics now occupies primary place” over rote calculation. Mathematicians must identify new questions or unexpected connections (“thinking up problems that “should be” studied”) and then explore them systematically. One mentor advises: _“Don’t get stuck on any single problem. Instead, let the problem guide you to a deeper overall understanding… that deeper understanding is what may eventually lead you full circle back to solving the original problem.”_. This flexibility—widely surveying problems and pursuing broader insight—is often crucial.

Rigour and precision are equally vital: a mathematician must _“work out the precise details of \. In other words, they internalize rigorous proof-writing and check every argument to ensure correctness. A good researcher also cultivates persistence and patience: major theorems can take years of effort (for example, Gonthier’s team spent six years formalizing the Feit–Thompson theorem). Learning from mistakes and dead-ends is part of the process; a healthy “growth mindset” helps one keep trying even when ideas fail.

Strong **analytical abstraction** is a hallmark: top mathematicians quickly shift between concrete examples and high-level abstractions (e.g. understanding a specific group action versus reasoning in category-theoretic language), and they maintain a “big picture” perspective while handling technical details. They also read widely, building on others’ work. Collaboration is common: researchers network and coauthor to compensate for gaps in their own knowledge. Indeed, one guide notes that as you advance, you should _“build up a robust enough network of collaborators to make up for any weaknesses of your own”_. Communication skills—writing clear proofs, giving talks, and explaining ideas—are expected. (While groundbreaking theorems won’t fail publication due to rough exposition, seasoned advice is to _“make \.) Other habits include systematic literature review, organizing work (often by breaking big problems into smaller steps), and time management. Soft skills like adaptability and teamwork are increasingly valued even in math: surveys rank creativity, collaboration, adaptability and communication among the top skills that professionals want.

In summary, a competitive pure-math researcher is extremely curious and imaginative, persistent in the face of difficulty, exquisitely precise in logic and notation, and adept at working collaboratively and communicating clearly. They combine deep abstract reasoning with technical mastery, and they balance intense focus on a problem with an openness to exploring new directions. Such habits and character traits—rigor, creativity, persistence, adaptability and collegiality—are as important as any individual theorem they know.

#### Computational Tools in Research

Modern mathematicians routinely use computer tools to support research. Three broad classes of software are employed:

*   **Symbolic Computation (Computer Algebra Systems):** These tools manipulate mathematical expressions in exact (symbolic) form. Examples include _Mathematica_ (Wolfram), _Maple_, _SageMath_, and _Magma_. For instance, _Mathematica_ is a comprehensive system that “allows symbolic computation” as well as numeric work, with built-in libraries for calculus, algebra, graphing, optimization, etc.. _Maple_ similarly “is a symbolic and numeric computing environment… covering symbolic mathematics, numerical analysis, data processing, visualization, and others”#:~:text=Maple%20is%20a%20symbolic%20,physical%20modeling%20and%20code%20generation). SageMath is an open-source environment that integrates many packages (NumPy, SciPy, Sympy, Maxima, GAP, etc.) under a common Python interface; its mission is “creating a viable free open source alternative to Magma, Maple, Mathematica and MATLAB”. Magma (proprietary) is highly optimized for algebra, number theory and geometry computations: it is “designed to solve problems in algebra, number theory, geometry and combinatorics”.
    
    These CAS are very powerful for tasks like factoring polynomials, solving symbolic equations, computing Gröbner bases, symbolic integration/differentiation, working with group or number-theoretic objects, and generating conjectural formulas. Their strength is speed and precision on algebraic manipulations (they never “blow up” with rounding error). However, they have limits: symbolic problems often grow combinatorially complex, and performance varies greatly between systems. As one user notes, “symbolic computation is extremely heavy-duty, and for almost any non-trivial task, performance varies wildly from software to software, with no single program being best for everything”. In practice mathematicians often use multiple CAS and choose the one best suited to a task (e.g. Sage or Magma for number-theoretic computations, Mathematica for complex algebraic expansions, etc.). In summary, symbolic tools automate tedious algebra and provide experimental insight into complicated formulas, but they complement rather than replace human reasoning.
    
*   **Numerical and Scientific Computing:** Numerical tools compute approximate solutions to mathematical problems. The prototypical system is **MATLAB**, a commercial numerical environment: _“MATLAB (Matrix Laboratory) is a proprietary… numeric computing environment… \. Such tools are used for large-scale linear algebra, eigenvalue problems, simulations, optimization, data fitting, finite-element PDE solvers (e.g. FEniCS, FreeFEM), and statistical analysis. They excel at numerical approximation, especially when exact symbolic answers are infeasible.
    
    Numerical tools allow exploration of mathematical behavior (e.g. plotting graphs of solutions, testing conjectures on many cases, estimating integrals or eigenvalues). However, their output is approximate and depends on floating-point arithmetic or discretization. As noted in the literature of **experimental mathematics**, numerical results alone “by themselves produce no insight, and symbolic computations frequently fail to produce full-fledged, closed-form solutions”. In other words, raw computations need a human to interpret. When combined with symbolic reasoning and creative insight, numerical experimentation can suggest patterns or guide proofs, but it is not a substitute for rigorous argument. Mathematicians use numerical tools for evidence and intuition, and to tackle problems (like PDEs) that have no exact solution formula.
    
*   **Formal Proof Assistants:** These are interactive theorem-proving systems (e.g. _Coq_, _Lean_, _Isabelle/HOL_, _HOL Light_, etc.) that allow users to build fully machine-checked proofs from logical foundations. They are based on formal logic and type theory, with a tiny trusted kernel that verifies each proof step. Historically, they have been used to verify both software and deep mathematical theorems. For example, Georges Gonthier’s group formalized the **Four-Color Theorem** and later the **Feit–Thompson odd-order theorem** in Coq, and Thomas Hales formalized the **Kepler conjecture** (sphere packing) in HOL Light (the Flyspeck project). Isabelle/HOL has been used to formalize the **Prime Number Theorem**#:~:text=Isabelle%20has%20been%20used%20to,the%20formal%20proofs%20are%2C%20as) and many algebraic structures, while Lean’s community (mathlib) has formalized vast areas of modern math (algebra, analysis, topology) and is actively working on projects like a formal proof of **Fermat’s Last Theorem**.
    
    These proof assistants are extremely powerful but require enormous effort: formalizing a major theorem can mean tens of thousands of lines of code and years of work. They excel at guaranteeing absolute correctness: once a proof is checked by a system like Coq or Lean, one is virtually certain there are no logical gaps. They also help organize mathematics into libraries of formally defined concepts. On the other hand, writing proofs in these systems is still much slower and more detailed than traditional paper proofs, so their use in daily research is growing slowly. Recently the development of libraries (e.g. Lean’s mathlib now has hundreds of thousands of lines of formalized math) and integration with automated reasoning (SMT solvers, AI tools) is making these assistants more practical.
    

In the **practice of current research**, all these tools play roles. Computer algebra systems and numerical software enable experimentation, checking examples, and sometimes discovering patterns or conjectures (though the human researcher must then prove them). Indeed, hybrid use of computers is now _“typical of modern experimental mathematics”_: we use symbolic and numeric computation _together_, guided by insight, to explore and formulate new facts. Formal proof assistants are beginning to shape future practice by making verified proofs attainable; as one visionary puts it, they allow breaking proofs into small verifiable pieces and ensure _“the correctness of proofs”_, opening new possibilities for collaboration and even for AI to assist with proofs.

In summary, a top pure-math PhD is expected to master classical mathematical theory and technique across algebra, geometry, analysis, topology, number theory, logic, etc., while possessing creativity, rigor, and persistence. They habitually combine human insight with modern computational tools: using CAS for algebraic manipulation, numerical codes for approximation and visualization, and beginning to employ proof assistants for rigorous verification. This blend of deep theoretical knowledge and adept use of computational tools underpins the competitive practice of contemporary mathematical research.

#### 1900年 希尔伯特的23个问题

1. 康托的连续统基数问题。
* 1874年，康托猜测在可数集基数和实数集基数之间没有别的基数，即著名的连续统假设。1938年，侨居美国的奥地利数理逻辑学家哥德尔证明连续统假设与ZF集合论公理系统的无矛盾性。1963年，美国数学家科恩（P.Choen）证明连续统假设与ZF公理彼此独立。因而，连续统假设不能用ZF公理加以证明。在这个意义下，问题已获解决。
2. 算术公理系统的无矛盾性。
* 欧氏几何的无矛盾性可以归结为算术公理的无矛盾性。希尔伯特曾提出用形式主义计划的证明论方法加以证明，哥德尔1931年发表不完备性定理作出否定。
* 根茨（G.Gentaen，1909-1945）1936年使用超限归纳法证明了算术公理系统的无矛盾性。
3. 只根据合同公理证明等底等高的两个四面体有相等之体积是不可能的。
* 问题的意思是：存在两个等高等底的四面体，它们不可能分解为有限个小四面体，使这两组四面体彼此全等，德思（M.Dehn）1900年已解决了这一问题。
4. 两点间以直线为距离最短线问题。
* 此问题提的一般。满足此性质的几何模型很多，因而需要加某些限制条件。1973年，苏联数学家波格列洛夫（Pogleov）宣布，在对称距离情况下，问题获解决。
5. 拓扑学成为李群的条件（拓扑群）。
* 这一个问题简称连续群的解析性，即是否每一个局部欧氏群都一定是李群。1952年，由格里森（Gleason）、蒙哥马利（Montgomery）、齐宾（Zippin）共同解决。1953年，日本的山迈英彦已得到完全肯定的结果。
6. 对数学起重要作用的物理学的公理化。
* 1933年，苏联数学家柯尔莫哥洛夫将概率论公理化。后来，在量子力学、量子场论方面取得成功。但对物理学各个分支能否全盘公理化，很多人有怀疑。
7. 某些数的超越性的证明。
* 需证：如果a是代数数，β是无理数的代数数，那么aβ一定是超越数或至少是无理数（例如，2√-2和exp(π)）。苏联的盖尔封特（Gelfond）1929年、德国的施奈德（Schneider）及西格尔（Siegel）1935年分别独立地证明了其正确性。但超越数理论还远未完成。目前，确定所给的数是否超越数，尚无统一的方法。
8. 素数分布问题，尤其对黎曼猜想、哥德巴赫猜想和孪生素数问题。
* 素数是一个很古老的研究领域。希尔伯特在此提到黎曼（Riemann）猜想、哥德巴赫（Goldbach）猜想以及孪生素数问题。黎曼猜想至今未解决。哥德巴赫猜想和孪生素数问题目前也未最终解决，其最佳结果均由中国数学家陈景润得出。
9. 一般互反律在任意数域中的证明。
* 1921年由日本的高木贞治，1927年由德国的阿廷（E.Artin）各自给以基本解决。而类域理论至今还在发展之中。
10. 能否通过有限步骤来判定不定方程是否存在有理整数解？
* 求出一个整数系数方程的整数根，称为丢番图（约公元前210-公元前290，古希腊数学家）方程可解。1950年前后，美国数学家戴维斯（Davis）、普特南（Putnan）、罗宾逊（Robinson）等取得关键性突破。1970年，巴克尔（Baker）、费罗斯（Philos）对含两个未知数的方程取得肯定结论。1970年， 苏联数学家马蒂塞维奇最终证明：在一般情况答案是否定的。尽管得出了否定的结果，却产生了一系列很有价值的副产品，其中不少和计算机科学有密切联系。
11. 一般代数数域内的二次型论。
* 德国数学家哈塞（Hasse）和西格尔（Siegel）在20年代获重要结果。60年代，法国数学家魏依（A.Weil）取得了新进展。
12. 类域的构成问题。
* 即将阿贝尔域上的克罗内克定理推广到任意的代数有理域上去。此问题仅有一些零星结果，离彻底解决还很远。
13. 一般七次代数方程以二变量连续函数之组合求解的不可能性。
* 七次方程x7+ax3+bx2+cx+1=0的根依赖于3个参数a、b、c；x=x(a,b,c)。这一函数能否用两变量函数表示出来？此问题已接近解决。1957年，苏联数学家阿诺尔德（Arnold）证明了任一在［0，1］上连续的实函数f(x1，x2，x3)可写成形式∑hi(ξi(x1,x2),x3)(i=1--9)，这里hi和ξi为连续实函数。柯尔莫哥洛夫证明f(x1,x2),x3)可写成形式∑hi(ξi1(x1)+ξi2(x2)+ξi3(x3))(i=1--7)这里hi和ξi为连续实函数，ξij的选取可与f完全无关。1964年，维土斯金（Vituskin）推广到连续可微情形，对解析函数情形则未解决。
14. 某些完备函数系的有限的证明。
*  即域K上的以x1,x2,…,xn为自变量的多项式fi（i=1,…，m），R为K［X1，…，Xm]上的有理函数F［X1，…，Xm]构成的环，并且F（f1，…，fm）∈K［X1，…，Xm]试问R是否可由有限个元素F1，…，FN的多项式生成？这个与代数不变量问题有关的问题，日本数学家永田雅宜于1959年用漂亮的反例给出了否定的解决。
15. 建立代数几何学的基础。
* 荷兰数学家范德瓦尔登1938年至1940年，魏依1950年已解决。舒伯特（Schubert）计数演算的严格基础。
* 一个典型的问题是：在三维空间中有四条直线，问有几条直线能和这四条直线都相交？舒伯特给出了一个直观的解法。希尔伯特要求将问题一般化，并给以严格基础。现在已有了一些可计算的方法，它和代数几何学有密切的关系。但严格的基础至今仍未建立。
1.   代数曲线和曲面的拓扑研究。
* 此问题前半部涉及代数曲线含有闭的分枝曲线的最大数目。后半部要求讨论备dx/dy=Y/X的极限环的最多个数N（n）和相对位置，其中X、Y是x、y的n次多项式。对n=2（即二次系统）的情况，1934年福罗献尔得到N(2)≥1；1952年鲍廷得到N(2)≥3；1955年苏联的波德洛夫斯基宣布N(2)≤3，这个曾震动一时的结果，由于其中的若干引理被否定而成疑问。关于相对位置，中国数学家董金柱、叶彦谦1957年证明了E（2）不超过两串。1957年，中国数学家秦元勋和蒲富金具体给出了n＝2的方程具有至少3个成串极限环的实例。1978年，中国的史松龄在秦元勋、华罗庚的指导下，与王明淑分别举出至少有4个极限环的具体例子。1983年，秦元勋进一步证明了二次系统最多有4个极限环，并且是（1，3）结构，从而最终地解决了二次微分方程的解的结构问题，并为研究希尔伯特第（16）问题提供了新的途径。
2.  半正定形式的平方和表示。
* 实系数有理函数f(x1,…，xn)对任意数组(x1,…，xn)都恒大于或等于0，确定f是否都能写成有理函数的平方和？1927年阿廷已肯定地解决。
18. 用全等多面体构造空间。
* 德国数学家比贝尔巴赫（Bieberbach）1910年，莱因哈特（Reinhart）1928年作出部分解决。
19. 正则变分问题的解是否总是解析函数？
* 德国数学家伯恩斯坦（Bernrtein，1929）和苏联数学家彼德罗夫斯基（1939）已解决。
20. 研究一般边值问题。
* 此问题进展迅速，己成为一个很大的数学分支。日前还在继读发展。
21. 具有给定奇点和单值群的Fuchs类的线性微分方程解的存在性证明。
* 此问题属线性常微分方程的大范围理论。希尔伯特本人于1905年、勒尔（H.Rohrl）于1957年分别得出重要结果。1970年法国数学家德利涅（Deligne）作出了出色贡献。
22. 用自守函数将解析函数单值化。
* 此问题涉及艰深的黎曼曲面理论，1907年克伯（P.Koebe）对一个变量情形已解决而使问题的研究获重要突破。其它方面尚未解决。
23. 发展变分学方法的研究。
* 这不是一个明确的数学问题。20世纪变分法有了很大发展。

#### 1967年 朗兰兹纲领
简介：1967年，年仅30岁的加拿大数学家罗伯特·朗兰兹在给美国数学家安德烈·韦伊的一封信中，提出了一组意义深远的猜想。这些猜想指出了三个相对独立发展起来的数学分支：数论、代数几何和群表示论，实际上它们是密切相关的这些猜想现在被称为朗兰兹互反猜想，而后演变成朗兰兹纲领，被称为数学界的“大统一理论”，在过去几十年里对数学的发展产生了极大影响。

### Learning Tips

Principles for choosing a suitable textbook:
  - **High-level viewpoint**: The "high-level viewpoint" in mathematics refers to approaching mathematical concepts, structures, and theories from a broader, more abstract perspective. This approach emphasizes understanding the `underlying principles` and `patterns` that unify different areas of mathematics, rather than focusing solely on specific problems or techniques. It seeks to reveal deep connections across various mathematical disciplines and to simplify complex problemsidentifying their essential features.
  - **High-quality exercises**: Well-designed exercises help students master mathematical concepts and techniquesproviding opportunities for practice and reinforcement. Also, high-quality exercises could promote critical thinking, and foster a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts.
  - **Well-explained**: A good mathematics textbook explains concepts clearly and concisely, making it easier for readers to grasp complex ideas. This is particularly important for **self-learners**.

### Pure Mathematics

`Pure mathematics` is the branch of mathematics that focuses on the study of mathematical concepts independent of any application outside mathematics. It is driven**abstract reasoning**, **logical rigor**, and the intrinsic beauty of **mathematical structures, patterns, and relationships**. Pure mathematics is not developed with any particular application in mind, although many of its discoveries often find applications much later, sometimes in entirely unexpected ways.

#### Analysis

`Analysis` is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of `change`, `motion`, and the **properties of real numbers**, including their behavior and the operations defined on them. It encompasses a variety of subfields that focus on `limits`, `continuity`, `differentiation`, `integration`, and the rigorous construction of the real and complex `number systems`. Analysis lays the foundation for understanding the quantitative aspects of the world and provides the essential tools for solving problems in physics, engineering, economics, and beyond.

Contemporary Abstract Algebra 这本教材很通俗易读，中学生也完全可以读懂，但是从数学专业来看，有些啰嗦，抽象程度不够。如果你本身数学基础一般的话，可以考虑用这本书作为代数的入门书。

代数里有一本书，amazon评价很高，就是 Algebra: Chapter 0 作者是 Paolo Aluffi，该书的特点是用范畴的观点贯穿全书，很现代，而且起点很低，低到什么程度，作者在群论部分，故意不使用带余除法定理，这是一个很基本的定理，可能小学生都知道。为什么不使用呢？原因是作者不假定读者已经知道这个定理。但是不要真的认为小学生能读懂此书，实际上这是一本数学研究生教科书，起点低，或者说对数学知识的要求低，不代表这本书容易读，实际上要读懂这本书，需要有一定的mathematical maturity，很多数学书都是这样，不需要读者懂很多数学，但是就是读不懂，原因就是读者的mathmatical maturity不够。还有要说明一点，这本书有很多typo，所以读前先到作者的官网上去看勘误表，不然会产生很多不必要的误解。电子版在这里可以买到https://bookstore.ams.org/gsm-104/  大概是七十多美金，你需要有一张可以刷美元的信用卡，当然不支持支付宝。

还有一点要注意的是1.里面曲面论基本定理的证明中有个地方漏印了两项,具体去问黄宣国老师吧.
一般说来,看上面两本书也就够了,可以考虑的扩充部分包括在2.的末尾所开列的参考书目.

##### Space Analytic Geometry

##### Classical Differential Geometry

##### Manifolds

** R. Bishop, S. Goldberg - **Tensor Analysis on Manifolds** - 应用

Munkres《Analysis on Manifolds》第三章第四章太啰嗦但其它章出奇的好，第一章我认为是写的最好的对拓扑和线性代数的review，讲Tensor那章也是很好，注意一点，学习这本书之前最好有过一些多元微积分的基础，否则看第三四章的时候有点空中楼阁的感觉

Loring Tu《An Introduction to Manifolds》简练易懂，且不需要多少点集拓扑的知识，有些notation很奇怪，比如开区间。对我来说，这本书最大的优点就在于它的诚实。很多书前言会写不需要太多prerequisites，但你读着读着就会发现作者在开玩笑。这本书作者真的就做到了。还有它的习题量合理，难度适中，且都有hint，极为适合自学。总之强推。

Algebraic Geometry (Graduate Texts in Mathematics, 52)
Robin Hartshorne或许是整个茧中数学社区最有热度的书了，骂它的人很多，我也必须承认即使我对它印象不错，它仍然有很多不足，比如self contained做的极差。但是我仍然认为它会是后来的大部分人无法绕过的一本书，因为它把大部分更高阶学习所需要的知识都写进去了，而且只用了五百页，非常短平快。如果只是想学点概形的废话，那么只需要看第二章，学点上同调就加上第三章，两百页内容可能比其它书七百页写的还多。如果要学点古典的有趣的几何，那么另外几章倒也不错。当然也可以不当教材而用来当字典查。

Etale Cohomology Theory, Revised Edition, by Lei Fu
或许不算很有名的书，但是我个人认为对于想学etale cohomology的人来说，绝对算是不会坏的书。作者基本上从零开始建立etale cohomology的理论，哪怕没有什么背景的人也应该能看懂这本书。证明写的非常详细，同时把etale cohomology的大部分理论都囊括进去了，哪怕懒得用这本书当教材，当成字典也是不错的。

因为
35.Alain Connes(Fields 82) "Noncommutative Geometry"
可以说是这一块的里程碑式的著作,(33.中甚至说今后人们会用今天看Riemann的就职演说的眼光看这本书)所以对于这本书的评论很多也就把整个分支都评论进去了,不妨看看.Jones说这书是"A milestone for mathematics.Connes has created a theory that embraces most aspects of `classical\' mathematics and sets us out on a long and exciting voyage into the world of noncommutative mathematics".做为老前辈,Segal的书评里面有一些批评,也值得注意.
第七章这一章一般不讲,在本科阶段不讲,在研究生阶段也不讲,实在奇怪,不是吗?主要问题是,就事论事地讨论广义函数
恐怕不是非常地有趣,要紧的还是这套框架在偏微分理论中的应用.现在的状态就是你在复旦数学系基础专业念四年出来可以还没听说过什么叫Sobolev空间,尽管大家都承认复旦的偏微是很强的...

##### Point Set Topology

★ Topology 2nd Edition
James Munkres

Counterexamples in Topology;Dover Books on Mathematics New edition
Lynn Arthur Steen, J. Arthur Seebach Jr.

** M. A. Armstrong - **Basic Topology** - 适合初学

General Topology
John Leroy Kelley, Sam Sloan (Foreword)

5.I.M.Singer, J.A.Thorp "Lecture notes on elementary topology and geometry
(中译本:(基础?)几何学与拓扑学讲义,干丹岩译)这是本极好的教材,应该可以用深入浅出来形容吧!第一作者Singer就是和Atiyah一起证指标定理的那位,说是重量级人物当无疑义.

R.Engelking "General Topology"
这书是七十年代末写的,内容翔实,至少对我来说是有包罗万象的感觉,当然对做这一块的人就不一定了.

Lectures on Elementary Topology and Geometry,I.M. Singer, J.A. Thorpe. 作者之一是 著名的Atiyah-Singer之一的Singer。这本书的内容在基础的拓扑学和几何学中dense。

##### Differential Topology

** Milnor - **从微分观点看拓扑**

Differential Topology Reprint Edition
Victor Guillemin, Alan Pollack


Topology from the Differentiable Viewpoint Revised Edition
John Willard Milnor

Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (Graduate Texts in Mathematics) 1st Edition
John M. Lee

##### Algebraic Topology

** A. Hatcher - **★ Algebraic Topology**无需多言的经典，特别是对初学者。讲得很细致，但是有点过于啰嗦。不过如果你能耐下心来阅读，就会发现作者其实很苦口婆心地叫你怎么样去理解拓扑。下功夫看这本书可以得到很好的几何上的直觉。

Topology and Geometry (Graduate Texts in Mathematics, 139) Corrected Edition
Glen E. Bredon

A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (Chicago Lectures in Mathematics) 1st Edition
J. P. May

Differential Forms in Algebraic Topology (Graduate Texts in Mathematics, 82)
Raoul Bott, Loring W. Tu
这本书写的相当不错，如果看Hatcher、may等等代数拓扑书对同调论没什么感觉，那么不妨看看这本书。它把很多代数拓扑的结论翻译成了de Rham版本的，同时搬到流形上，在这种对称性比较好的空间里，同调论的意义可以看的更清楚。同时这本书还教了Cech上同调、谱序列等等比较“吓人”的东西，告诉了读者如何使用它们。Griffith的rational homotopy theory and differential forms也是类似的书，同样相当不错，感兴趣的可以看看。

Greenberg "Lectures on Algebraic Topology"
属于写得很通俗易懂,配置合理的那一类.

W.S.Massay"Algebraic Topology: An Introduction"(GTM 56)
也是写得很好的书.

##### Fractal Geometry

##### Symplectic Topology


**Morse Theory and Floer Homology**, by Michele Audin, Mihai Damian
一本讲hamilton Floer理论的书，同时也算得上是辛拓扑入门书。辛拓扑入门一直不是个容易的事，市面上很多顶着辛拓扑名字的书大部分内容都是很古典的辛拓扑，比如dusa mcduff的introduction to symplectic topology ，对现代辛拓扑基本上是蜻蜓点水般地介绍。而这本书基本上讲了必要的古典辛拓扑知识，然后细致地引领读者学习现代辛拓扑的理论，同时以Arnold猜想的证明为引子来导出floer同调，让读者至少有一点动机去学习如此复杂的理论。


##### Lagrangian Floer Theory

**Fukaya Categories and Picard–Lefschetz Theory**, Paul Seidel
或许对于想学Lagrangian floer theory的人来说，这本书称得上是最好的选择了。这本书讲了需要的同调代数知识（ A∞A_\inftyA_\infty category），同时快速“复习”了一下经典的floer理论，然后导出Fukaya category，然后讲了一些Fukaya category的计算方法。

#### Combinatorics

**Polynomial Methods in Combinatorics**, by Larry Guth
  - This book discusses the application of polynomial methods and algebraic geometry methods in combinatorics, and relation to Harmonic analysis, Fourier analysis, Number theory, differential geometry.
  - Terence Tao: It is extremely challenging to present a current research area in a manner that a good mathematics undergraduate would be able to grasp after a reasonable effort, but the author is quite successful in this task, and this would be a book of value to both undergraduates and graduates！

I.Tomescu "组合学引论"
的话,倒还是想说两句的.首先,这是本很好的书,不管上不上这门课都值得一读.其次,这本书的习题不是很好做的,特别是没有答案:)(严肃的说,当你看到许多习题后面都标有人物,年代,就该知道这些结果不是那么平凡的了)作为补充,可以考虑
2.I.Tomescu "Problem in graph theory and combinatorics(???)"
这本书有比较详细的提示和解答,里面的题目也非常好,高二的时候曾和一个哥们把里面的题目抄了一遍(当时条件简陋,没法复印的说...//sigh).不过复旦是不是有我不是最清楚.但是我可以肯定的是,下面这本书总书库里面有很多:
3.Lovasz "Problems in Combinatorics(?)"
这是本相当好的习题集,作者Lovasz是唯一一个得过wolf奖的组合学家.唯一的可能有麻烦的地方这本书的块头大了点,不过千万不要被吓倒!(这里应当声明,已经快五年没好好看过组合书了,所以脑子里面的印象难免有所偏差,还望大家原谅)
有一些书是讲图论的,其中比较好的书大概可以算

- Thomas Jech - **Set Theory: an Introduction to Independence Proofs** - 适合初学  Jech T.J.
Set Theory, Pure and Applied Mathematics, Academic Press, 1978
集合论中最经典的入门读物，98年出了修订版。作者是匈牙利人，后来因为布拉格之春逃了出来。先后在普林斯顿，PSU任教。现已退休，回到匈牙利，正在重写这本书。现在中国集合论界的第一高手就是他的弟子，呵呵。这本书的一大特点就是全，几乎囊括了集合论的各个分支。据说现在要去Berkeley都Ph.D.首先得把这本书看完。
- Keneth Kunen - **Set Theory** - 难度高

Moschovakis Y.N.
Descriptive set theory, Studies in logic and the Foundations of Mathematics n°100, North Holland, 1980
描述集合论的经典教材，作者是波兰人，UCLA学派的领袖人物。对于经典描述集合论讲得非常精彩，而且只需要很少的预备知识。

Kechris

一本unreadable的递归论百科式的参考书，可以当字典来看。

##### Model Theory - 模型论

- David Marker - **Model Theory: an Introduction**


Barwise J., Feferman S.
Model-theoretic logics, Perspectives in Mathematical Logic, 1985
想起来了，这本书狂厚，是抽象模型轮的一部大百科全书。做教材是绝对不适合的，呵呵。


Kunen K.
Set Theory, North Holland, 1980
当年美国数理逻辑研究生的必修教材。绝对是一本好书。相比较于Jech的书，这本书集中于组合与描述集合论。对Forcing讲得非常透彻。如果想学集合论，强烈推荐这本书。
