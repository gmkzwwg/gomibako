## General Prompts

#### For Academic Research (Discovery & Synthesis)

**The "Core Argument" Extractor:**

"I will provide the text of a research paper. Please identify: 1) The primary research question, 2) The methodology used, 3) The key findings, and 4) Any limitations acknowledged by the authors. Present this in a bulleted summary."

**The "Research Gap" Finder:**

"Based on the following summary of current literature in [Field], what are the most prominent unresolved questions or 'research gaps' that a Master's thesis could realistically address?"

**The Comparative Analysis:**

"Compare and contrast the theoretical frameworks of [Author A] and [Author B] regarding [Topic]. Create a table showing their points of agreement, disagreement, and their fundamental assumptions."

#### 2. For Deep Knowledge Learning (The Socratic Method)

Avoid passive reading. Use these to ensure you actually *understand* the material:

**The Feynman Technique (Simplicity Test):**

"Explain the concept of [e.g., Deconstruction in Literature] to me as if I am a first-year undergraduate student. Use analogies and avoid unnecessary jargon. Then, ask me two questions to check if I understood the core principle."

**Mental Model Integration:**

"How does the concept of [New Concept] relate to or conflict with what I already know about [Known Concept]? Help me build a mental bridge between these two ideas."

**The Devil's Advocate (Critical Thinking):**

"I am studying [Theory]. Please provide three strong academic critiques of this theory and explain why some scholars find its methodology problematic."

#### 3. For Note-Taking & Knowledge Management

**The "Cornell Note" Transformer:**

"Transform the following transcript/raw notes into a Cornell Note-taking format. Include a column for 'Keywords/Cues', a section for 'Detailed Notes', and a 3-sentence 'Summary' at the bottom."

**Taxonomy & Tagging:**

"I am adding this note to my digital garden (Obsidian/Notion). Based on the content below, suggest 5 relevant tags and a 'Parent Category' that would help me find this note later when researching [Broad Subject]."

**Synthesis for Zettelkasten:**

"Read this note and rewrite it as a 'Permanent Note' (Zettelkasten style). It should be atomic (one idea), written in my own words, and include a section titled 'Connection to other ideas' suggesting how it might link to [Topic X] or [Topic Y]."

#### 4. Refining Titles & Structures (The "Polish" Prompts)

**The Professional Titler:**

"I have written a set of notes exploring the intersection of [Topic A] and [Topic B]. Suggest 5 titles that range from 'Academic/Formal' to 'Conceptual/Creative'."


**The Outline Optimizer:**

"Here is my current outline for a paper on [Topic]. Does the logical flow make sense? Are there any sections that feel redundant or missing based on standard academic structures in [Field]?"

#### 5. Roadmap Construction
