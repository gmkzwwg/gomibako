## Meta Features of Narratology

**Aiming of Narratology** [ˌnærəˈtɒlədʒi]: To understand how stories are constructed and how they communicate meaning and affect human perception.

**Focus**:
  1. The form and structure of storytelling - How stories are told.
  2. Plot, characters, time, space, etc. - Elements of stories.
  3. Narrative mechanics - How meaning is created and received.

**Interdisciplinary Nature**: Crosses into literature, linguistics, psychology, film, media, and even digital technologies.

**Key Concepts**:
  - **Narrative** [ˈnærətɪv]: Sequence of events arranged in a coherent order.
  - **3 Layers of a Narrative Text** (at every layer there's an **agent**):
    - **Fabula or story (actors)**: The chronological events happened in the story.
    - **Syuzhet or plot (focalizers)**: The way the story is told through narrative technology.
    - **Texts or words (narrators)**: A text in which a narrative agent tells a story.
  - **Narrator**: The fictional storyteller lives in the story.
    - *By perspective*: First-person, third-person, second-person.
    - *By knowledge*: Omniscient, limited, objective.
    - *By reliability*: Reliable, irreliable.
  - **Author**: A real person who writes the texts.
    - **Implied Author**: A persona constructed by the text, reflects
  - **Focalization**: Who's perspective is being conveyed.
    - **Internal Focalization**: The perspective of a character.
    - **External Focalization**: A perspective outside any character (e.g., objective).
    - **Zero Focalization**: An omniscient perspective.
  - **Plot**: The causal arrangement of events structured by time, logic, and tension.
  - **Time**: How time is manipulated in storytelling.
     - *By order*: Chronological vs. non-linear.
     - *By duration*: Elision, summary, scene, stretch.
     - *By frequency*: Singulative (once), repetitive (more than once), iterative (generalization).

**Key Theorists and Texts**
   - **Aristotle**: *Poetics* - Early ideas of plot and character in drama.
   - **Vladimir Propp**: *Morphology of the Folktale* - Functions and character archetypes.
   - **Gérard Genette**: *Narrative Discourse* - Analysis of narrative structure and time.
   - **Roland Barthes**: *S/Z* - Role of the reader and semiotics in texts.
   - **Seymour Chatman**: *Story and Discourse* - Structuralist approach to narrative.
   - **Mieke Bal**: *Narratology* - Introduction to the theory of narrative and its methods.

**Breif History**:
1. **Theoretical Lineage**:   
  - In Poetics, `Aristotle` analyzed the structure of tragedy and epic poetry, introducing key concepts such as mythos (plot), mimesis (imitation), and catharsis (emotional purging).
2. **Modern Foundations**:.
  1. `Russian Formalism` (1910s–1920s): Scholars like Viktor Shklovsky and Boris Tomashevsky focused on form and device, distinguishing between `fabula` (the raw sequence of events in a story) and `syuzhet` (the way these events are presented in the narrative).
  2. `Structuralism` (1950s–1970s): Inspired by linguistics, structuralists sought universal principles underlying narratives.
3. **Establishment of Modern Narratology**：
  - **Tzvetan Todorov** coined the term narratology in 1960s, and defined it as the study of narrative’s grammatical structure, similar to the way linguistics studies language.
4. **Focus Shifting**:
  - `Post-Structuralism` (1970s–1980s): Post-structuralist theorists shifted focus from universal structures to the instability of meaning and the role of readers in constructing narratives.
  **Gérard Genette** Developed key concepts in narrative theory, including:  
  `Narrative levels` (e.g., extradiegetic vs. intradiegetic narrators).  
  `Temporal structures` (e.g., Analepsis/flashback and prolepsis/flashforward).  
  `Focalization`, i.e. the perspective through which the story is perceived.
1. **Recent Development**:
  - `Cognitive narratology`: rather than focus on the structure of the story, cognitive narratology asks "how humans make sense of stories" and "how humans use stories as sense-making instruments".
  - `Postclassical Narratology`: Moves beyond classical structuralism to address diverse and complex forms of storytelling, such as:
   - `Feminist Narratology`: Examines how gender shapes narratives and their interpretation.
   - `Transmedia Narratology`: Studies storytelling across multiple media platforms (e.g., novels, films, games). - `Queer and Postcolonial Narratology`: Explores how marginalized identities and perspectives are represented in narratives.
  - `Digital Narratives`: The rise of digital media, hypertext, and video games has challenged traditional narrative structures, leading to new questions about interactivity and nonlinear storytelling.


## Fabula and Syuzhet

`story, fable, or fabula` (Russian: фабула, IPA: [ˈfabʊlə]): the raw material of a story, i.e. the chronological sequence of events within the world of a narrative.  

`discourse, plot, or syuzhet` (Russian: сюжет, IPA: [sʲʊˈʐɛt]): the way a story is organized, i.e. the sequence of events as they are presented to the reader.  

Classical narratives tend to have synchronous fabula and syuzhet, but they may be treated asynchronously according to a modern or postmodern style.

## Narrator and Author

`Author` is the real person who wrote the text. His/Her real-life beliefs may differ from fictions.

`Implied Author` is constructed by the text, like a persona seems to "write" the fiction genuinely and sincerely.

`Narrator` is a fictional character lives in the story and directly narrates the story in his sight.

### Narrator - Who is telling the story

The narrator is the voice or entity within the story responsible for telling the narrative.
  - **Role**: The narrator presents the events, characters, and settings to the audience. They may also comment on the story or provide interpretations.
  - **Relationship to authors**: The narrators are fictionaly constructs created by authors, and exist solely whithin texts.

Narrators **produce** the narrative voice, and their personality, perspective, and attitude are expressed through it. They shape how the audience perceives the story through **their** voice.

**Key Features**:
  - **Reliability**: Reliable Narrator, Unreliable Narrator
  - **Point of View**: First-person, second-person, or third-person perspective.

### Narrative Voice of Narrator - How the story is told

`Narrative Voice`:
  - The narrative voice refers to the distinct style, tone, and personality of the storytelling. It reflects how the narrator "speaks" or "sounds" to the audience.
  - It involves the **narrator's identity**, **perspective**, and **tone**. 
  - It influences how the audience experiences the story world and interprets the events within it.

**Key features**: 
  - **Point of View**: First-person, second-person, or third-person perspective.
  - **Narrative Distance**: Close Distance, Far Distance.
  - **Tone**: Serious, Humorous, Iroinc, Nostalgic, Angry, Detached
  - **Sytle**:
    - **Diction** (Word Choice): Formal, Informal
    - **Syntax** (Sentence Structure): Short, choppy sentences; Long, flowing sentences
    - **Imagery**
    - **Figurative Language**: metaphors, similes, personification, or other literary devices
    - **Narrative Flow**: Linear style, Fragmented style
    - **Level of Detail**: Sparse style, Elaborate style

`First-Person Voice`
  - The narrator is a character within the story and speaks using "I" or "we."
  - Offers a **subjective perspective** since the narrator's understanding of events is **limited** to their own knowledge and experiences.
  - Pros:
   - Intimate and personal; readers see events through the narrator’s eyes.
   - Provides deep insight into the narrator’s thoughts and emotions.
  - Cons:
   - Limited scope; readers only know what the narrator knows.
   - Potentially unreliable if the narrator is biased or withholding information.
  - e.g. In *The Catcher in the Rye* by J.D. Salinger, Holden Caulfield’s first-person narration confines the reader to his view of the world, which is subjective and unreliable. 

`Second-Person Voice`
  - The narrator speaks directly to the reader using "you," making the reader a character in the story.
  - Rare and often experimental, creating a unique and immersive experience.
  - Pros:
   - Engages the reader directly, making them an active participant.
   - Creates a sense of immediacy and involvement.
  - Cons:
   - Can feel artificial or forced if not executed well.
   - Limited use in traditional storytelling.
  - e.g. *If on a Winter's Night a Traveler* by Italo Calvino. 

`Third-Person Voice`
  - The narrator exists outside the story and refers to characters as "he," "she," or "they."
  - **Types of Third-Person Voice**:
    1. **Third-Person Omniscient (All-Knowing)**:
      - The narrator knows everything about all characters, events, and settings. They **can access any character’s thoughts, actions, and pasts**, and they may even offer commentary or reflections on the story. This type of voice is not limited by time or space, and their knowledge is all-encompassing. 
      - Characteristic: Provides a broad, god-like perspective.
      - *e.g. In *War and Peace* by Leo Tolstoy, the narrator has access to the thoughts, feelings, and fates of numerous characters across vast time periods and locations.

    2. **Third-Person Limited (Restricted Knowledge)**:
      - The narrator’s knowledge is confined to one particular character (usually the protagonist) or a small group of characters. They **only know what the chosen character(s) know and may not have access to the inner thoughts of others or broader events beyond that character’s perspective**.
      - Characteristic: Balances intimacy with some level of objectivity.
      - e.g. In *The Great Gatsby* by F. Scott Fitzgerald, Nick Carraway is the narrator, and his knowledge of other characters is limited to his observations and interactions with them.

    3. **Third-Person Objective (Neutral)**:
      - The narrator **presents events and dialogue WITHOUT revealing any character's internal thoughts or emotions**. This type of narrator is more detached and objective, focusing solely on what can be seen or heard, much like a camera recording events.
      - Characteristic: Creates a detached, observational tone.
      - e.g. In *Ernest Hemingway's Hills Like White Elephants*, the narrator only describes what is directly observable, leaving the inner thoughts of the characters unspoken.

### Reliability of Narrator

**Reliability** of Narrator:
  - **Reliable Narrator**: A reliable narrator tells the story in a straightforward, truthful manner. Their account is consistent, accurate, and aligned with the events of the story. The audience can trust what they say is actually how the story happened.  
  e.g. In *Pride and Prejudice* by Jane Austen, the third-person narrator offers a relatively objective and reliable account of the events and characters, without noticeable distortion or deliberate ambiguity.
  - **Unreliable Narrator**: An unreliable narrator is one whose account cannot be fully trusted, either because they lack knowledge, are biased, or intentionally deceive the reader.
   - **Naïve Narrator**: The narrator may lack the knowledge or experience to interpret events correctly. This may happen when the narrator is a child, an outsider, or someone unfamiliar with the situation.  
   e.g. In *The Catcher in the Rye* by J.D. Salinger, Holden Caulfield is a first-person narrator who is emotionally unstable and unable to interpret situations clearly, causing his account to be unreliable.
   - **Delusional Narrator**: The narrator may have a distorted perception of reality due to mental illness, self-deception, or hallucinations, making their account unreliable.
   e.g. In *The Tell-Tale Heart* by Edgar Allan Poe, the narrator is insane, and his delusions make his version of events unreliable.
   - **Intentional Deceiver**: The narrator may deliberately lie or withhold information to manipulate the audience or achieve their goals. This is often seen in first-person narratives where the narrator has an agenda.  
   e.g. In *Gone Girl* by Gillian Flynn, the alternating narrators (Nick and Amy) intentionally mislead the audience to shape the perception of their characters and manipulate the reader's trust.
   - **Selective Narrator**: This narrator selectively reveals or withholds information, leaving the audience to fill in the gaps and interpret the truth. While they may not intentionally deceive, **they withhold key facts** to shape the story in a particular way.  
   e.g. In *The Great Gatsby* by F. Scott Fitzgerald, Nick Carraway is selective about what he reveals, leading the reader to question the reliability of his portrayal of Gatsby and other characters.

Why Use an Unreliable Narrator?
  - Create Suspense: By misleading or withholding information, an unreliable narrator can generate mystery and suspense, forcing the reader to question what is real and what is not.
  - Highlight Subjectivity: An unreliable narrator can illustrate how perception, personal biases, or emotions shape one’s understanding of reality.
  - Engage the Reader: The reader becomes more involved in the process of interpreting the story, actively piecing together the truth and analyzing the discrepancies between the narrator’s account and the actual events.
  - Comment on Truth and Reality: Unreliable narrators can challenge the concept of objective truth and suggest that reality is subjective and shaped by personal experiences or emotions.

`Meta-narrative`
  - A narrative that reflects on its own storytelling process, often blurring the line between the author and narrator.  
  e.g. In *Don Quixote* by Miguel de Cervantes, the text often engages in self-reflection, with characters within the story discussing the book itself and how they are part of the narrative.

### Distance of Voice

`Narrative distance` refers to the "space" or separation between the narrator and the story being told.
  - Types of Narrative Distance: 
    - Temporal Distance -> the time between the story happened and be told
    - Emotional Distance -> emotion of the narrator, invested or detached
    - Psychological Distance -> thoughts and feelings of characters
    - Spatial Distance -> narrator present in story or not
 
`Temporal Distance`
  - Refers to the amount of time that has passed between the events of the story and the moment the narrator recounts them.
   - **Close Temporal Distance**: The narrator tells the story as events happen or **immediately after**.  
   Effect: Creates immediacy and intimacy.  
   e.g. Present-tense narration in stream-of-consciousness works like *Mrs. Dalloway* by Virginia Woolf.
   - **Distant Temporal Distance**: The narrator reflects on events **long after they occurred**, often with the benefit of hindsight.  
   Effect: Adds a reflective, almost mythical quality.  
   e.g. *The Great Gatsby* by F. Scott Fitzgerald: Nick Carraway narrates from a point in the future, reflecting on past events.

`Emotional Distance`
  - Describes how emotionally connected or detached the narrator is from the story.
   - **Close Emotional Distance**: The narrator is **highly involved**, expressing strong feelings about the events.  
   Effect: Involves readers in the narrator’s emotional journey.  
   e.g. *Jane Eyre* by Charlotte Brontë: Jane narrates with emotional investment in her life story.
   - **Distant Emotional Distance**: The narrator recounts events objectively, without emotional involvement.  
   Effect: Creates a detached, observational tone.  
   E.g. *Hills Like White Elephants* by Ernest Hemingway (narrator presents events without commentary or emotional tone).

`Psychological Distance`
  - Refers to **how much the narrator reveals about their thoughts and feelings**, or how intimately they delve into the minds of characters.
   - **Close Psychological Distance**: The narrator provides detailed insight into the inner thoughts and feelings of characters.  
   Effect: Deepens the psychological complexity of characters.  
   e.g. *Anna Karenina* by Leo Tolstoy (third-person omniscient narrator reveals characters' inner lives).
   - **Distant Psychological Distance**: The narrator focuses on external actions and dialogue without delving into characters’ internal experiences.  
   Effect: Focuses on societal issues rather than individual psychology.  
   e.g. *The Lottery* by Shirley Jackson (objective and detached).

`Spatial Distance`
  - Refers to the physical or geographical "closeness" of the narrator to the events or characters.
   - **Close Spatial Distance**: The narrator is physically present in the events, participating or observing closely.
   e.g. First-person narration in *The Catcher in the Rye* by J.D. Salinger.
   - Distant Spatial Distance: The narrator is removed from the scene, recounting events from afar.  
   e.g. *The Lord of the Rings* by J.R.R. Tolkien (omniscient narrator spans vast distances).

How Narrative Distance Affects Storytelling? 
  - Engagement and Intimacy: 
   - Close narrative distance creates **a sense of intimacy, pulling readers into the narrator's perspective and emotions**.
   - Distant narrative distance creates **objectivity**, allowing readers to **interpret the events without being influenced by the narrator's emotional involvement**.
  - Reliability of the Narrator:
   - Close distance often involves a more subjective, potentially **unreliable** narrator.
   - Distant distance can feel more **objective** and authoritative but might **lack emotional depth**.
  - Pacing and Focus:
   - Close distance **slows down** the narrative, focusing on **detailed descriptions** or inner thoughts.
   - Distant distance moves the plot forward **quickly**, focusing on **events** rather than details.

### Tone and Style of Narrative Voice

Tone reflects the narrator’s **attitude and mood** through their choice of words, style, and perspective.

Serious Tone

### Style of Narrative Voice

Style reflects the narrator’s personality and the way they use language

 - Diction (Word Choice): Formal, informal, poetic, sarcastic, etc.
  - Syntax (Sentence Structure): Short, fragmented sentences may suggest urgency, while long, flowing sentences create a reflective tone.
  - Imagery and Figurative Language: Vivid, descriptive language can evoke specific emotions.
  - Pacing: Fast pacing may feel exciting or chaotic, while slow pacing feels contemplative or melancholic.

### Author

The `Author` is the actual individual who writes the text.
  - **Their voice does NOT appear directly** in the text, while their intentions, historical context, and personal experiences may influence the narrative.

The `Implied Author` is the one seems to "speak" through the text, the persona that can be inferred from the narrative voice, structure, and thematic elements, rather than a real person. 
  - The implied author **reflects the values, ideas, and perspectives embedded in the narrative**, even if they differ from the author's real-life beliefs.  
  - e.g. In *1984* by George Orwell, the implied author might be seen as someone critical of totalitarianism, a perspective inferred from the text rather than from Orwell’s direct commentary.

**"Death of the Author"** by Roland Barthes
  - Once a text is created, the author's intentions, background, and personal life should not limit or dictate the interpretation of the text. Instead, readers should **focus on the text itself**, interpreting it based on its own internal logic rather than the author's personal intentions.  
  i.e. The meaning of the text is shaped by the reader's engagement with it, rather than by the author's intentions or biography.

## Reader and Narratee

### Reader

The `reader` refers to the actual person, the audience who interprets and makes sense of the narrative being presented.

Key Aspects of the Reader in Narratology:
  - **Interpretative Role**: The reader plays an active role in interpreting the narrative. While the narrator tells the story, the reader processes it, fills in gaps, and derives meaning from the text.
  - **Subjectivity**: The reader brings their own experiences, knowledge, and perspectives to the interpretation of the story. This can influence how a text is understood and the meanings assigned to it.
  - **Reader-Response Theory**: This literary theory emphasizes the role of the reader in the creation of meaning. It suggests that the reader actively participates in the process of interpreting the text, and that meaning is co-constructed between the text and the reader.  
  e.g. In *The Great Gatsby*, different readers may interpret Gatsby’s motives and character in varying ways based on their own values, experiences, and cultural contexts.

Types of Readers:
  - `Ideal Reader`: The reader the text seems to anticipate or appeal to. This is often a "model" reader who is equipped to understand the nuances of the text.
  - `Implied Reader`: The reader that the author or text implicitly addresses or constructs through its style, structure, and content.
  - `Actual Reader`: The real person who reads the text, bringing their own context to the experience.

### Narratee

`Narratee`:
  - The narratee is the fictional audience or character(s) within the story world, to whom the narrator is telling the story.
  - The narratee can be explicit or implied.
  - The relationship between the narrator and the narratee can provide insight into the narrative’s tone, style, and themes.

Key Aspects of the Narratee in Narratology:
  - `Fictional Audience`: The narratee is often a character or a group of characters within the story world who listens to or receives the narrator’s account of events. They are **typically an invisible audience who may or may not respond to the narrative**.  
  e.g. In *Heart of Darkness* by Joseph Conrad, the narrator Marlow is telling his story to an unnamed, passive audience aboard a ship. The audience is the narratee, but they do not interact with the narrative in the way the reader does.
  - `Implied Narratee`: The implied narratee is the kind of reader or listener the narrator expects, even though they may not appear explicitly in the narrative. This concept links back to the idea of the "ideal reader" as the audience the narrator envisions while telling the story.  
  e.g. In a first-person narrative like *The Catcher in the Rye*, Holden Caulfield seems to be speaking directly to an implied audience, though the narrator never explicitly acknowledges them. The narratee is a listener who is presumed to understand Holden’s subjective and often contradictory point of view.
  - `Narrative Function`: The narratee **plays a critical role in shaping how the story is told**. The narrator tailors their narrative to the presumed knowledge, interests, and reactions of the narratee. **This interaction influences the pacing, detail, and focus of the narrative**.  
  e.g. In *The Canterbury Tales* by Geoffrey Chaucer, the pilgrims on their journey act as narratees to the stories being told by others. The storytelling dynamics change depending on the narratee’s reaction or the purpose of the story within the narrative.

## Focalization


## Structural Narratology

Vladimir Propp’s *Morphology of the Folktale* (1928) is a foundational work in narratology that studies the structure of Russian fairy tales. Propp analyzed the common patterns found in these tales and broke them down into 31 *narrative functions* and 7 *character archetypes*.

### 1. **Propp's 31 Narrative Functions**

These 31 functions describe the basic components of folktales that follow a similar narrative structure. Each function can be applied to different characters or events within the story, and they help to establish a consistent pattern for the progression of the plot.

Propp’s functions are typically listed in the following sequence, though not all of them appear in every folktale. The functions are numbered for clarity:

#### 1. **Absentation**: A family member (usually the hero’s father or another authority figure) leaves or is removed from the family or home.  
   - Example: In *Cinderella*, her father leaves, and she is left under the control of her stepmother.

#### 2. **Interdiction**: A prohibition or rule is set by the authority figure, which the hero must obey.  
   - Example: The hero is told not to go somewhere or do something.

#### 3. **Violation of Interdiction**: The hero disobeys the prohibition.  
   - Example: The hero goes into the forbidden area, against the instructions of the authority figure.

#### 4. **Reconnaissance**: The villain makes an attempt to gather information about the hero or their family.  
   - Example: A villain might spy on the hero or attempt to find out their weaknesses.

#### 5. **Delivery**: The villain receives information about the hero, or the hero is delivered into danger.  
   - Example: A messenger tells the villain where the hero is, or the hero is sent on a dangerous quest.

#### 6. **Trickery**: The villain attempts to deceive the hero into believing something false.  
   - Example: A disguised villain tricks the hero into thinking they are someone trustworthy.

#### 7. **Complicity**: The hero is tricked or deceived into assisting the villain in some way.  
   - Example: The hero might unknowingly help the villain, thinking they are doing the right thing.

#### 8. **Villainy**: The villain commits an immoral or harmful act against the hero or their family.  
   - Example: The villain steals the hero’s possessions or causes harm to a loved one.

#### 9. **Mediation**: The hero learns about the villainy and seeks help or justice.  
   - Example: The hero is informed of the villain’s actions and sets out on a mission to resolve the conflict.

#### 10. **Counteraction**: The hero begins to act in opposition to the villain.  
   - Example: The hero starts preparing to confront the villain or embark on the adventure.

#### 11. **Departure**: The hero sets out on the quest or begins their adventure.  
   - Example: The hero leaves their home to search for something or fight the villain.

#### 12-25. **Series of Tests**: These are functions where the hero undergoes a series of challenges, often involving supernatural aid or magical objects, and meets allies or helpers.  
   - Examples: The hero may receive guidance from a magical being, complete tasks, or face trials that test their resolve or abilities.

#### 26. **Victory**: The hero defeats the villain or solves the problem.  
   - Example: The hero kills the villain or breaks a curse.

#### 27. **Return**: The hero returns to the starting point, often with a reward or a significant change in their life.  
   - Example: The hero comes back home after completing their task.

#### 28. **Pursuit**: The villain attempts to catch the hero or undo the hero’s success.  
   - Example: The villain may chase the hero to reclaim something stolen.

#### 29. **Rescue**: The hero is helped in some way, usually by supernatural forces, to escape the villain or their trap.  
   - Example: A magical being or a helpful animal aids the hero in escaping danger.

#### 30. **Unfounded Claims**: The hero is falsely accused or confronted with a problem that needs resolution.  
   - Example: The hero might be accused of something they didn’t do.

#### 31. **Marriage**: The hero is rewarded, often with marriage to a princess or the acquisition of wealth.  
   - Example: The hero marries a princess, or they gain the reward they were seeking.

### 2. **The 7 Character Archetypes**

In addition to the 31 narrative functions, Propp identified 7 character types (or archetypes) that appear repeatedly in folktales. Each archetype plays a specific role in advancing the narrative.

#### 1. **The Hero (Seeker)**:  
   - The hero is the main character who embarks on the quest. They are typically young, brave, and eager to prove themselves. The hero is the one who undergoes the trials and defeats the villain.

### Application of Propp’s Theory:
- **Folktales**: Propp’s analysis is particularly useful for analyzing Russian folktales, but his theory can be applied to other fairy tales, myths, and even modern storytelling. His functions and archetypes help us understand how narratives are structured and what roles different characters play in advancing the plot.

- **Modern Literature & Film**: The influence of Propp’s functions and character archetypes can also be found in contemporary films, TV shows, and novels. Many modern narratives, especially in the fantasy or adventure genre, follow a similar structure to Propp's model.

By analyzing the 31 narrative functions and 7 character archetypes, we can gain insight into the universal elements of storytelling and how they contribute to the narrative’s progression.
