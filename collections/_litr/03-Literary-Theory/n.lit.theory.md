## What and How Problems

### What is Literary Theory

On OREL:

Literary Theory is the `practice` of theoretical, methodological, and sociological **reflection** that accompanies the **reading** and **interpretation** of **literary texts**; it investigates the conceptual foundations of textual scholarship, the `dynamics of textuality`, the relations between literary and other texts, and the categories and social conditions through which our engagement with texts is organized. If the study of literary texts produces a kind of knowledge, it asks what kind of knowledge that is and on what grounds its claim to authority and distinctiveness might be based.

> The `dynamics of textuality` refers to **the ways in which texts function, evolve, and interact within cultural, linguistic, and interpretive contexts**. It explores the active and fluid processes by which meaning is generated, negotiated, and transformed in texts over time and across different readers or audiences. This concept includes considerations of how texts relate to their form, structure, intertextual connections, and the sociocultural factors that shape their creation and reception. I.e:
> - **Intertextuality**: How a text references, builds upon, or interacts with other texts.
> - **Reader Response**: How the meaning of a text changes depending on the perspective or background of the reader.
> - **Cultural Context**: How historical, political, or social factors influence the interpretation of a text.
> - **Fluidity of Meaning**: How the meaning of a text can shift over time or across different interpretive communities.

Since around the turn of the century literary studies has turned against the “high theory” moment of the previous three decades, and more generally against its privileged model of textuality or of cultural or linguistic mediation. It has also been marked by a structural reaction against the dominance of the US academy and toward a recognition of “world” literature. The effect of these shifts has been the development of new forms of engagement with theory: a new pragmatism; ethical criticism; affect theory; the critique of critique; the “new materialism”; the rise of ever more fine-grained forms of identity politics; the rise of new models of formalism and new models of political engagement; and a return to or reinvention of poetics or rhetoric.[^orel]

#### The similarity between Literary Theory and philosophy

- Asking fundamental questions.
- Building systems.
- Focus on Human Experience.
- Both rely on theoretical frameworks to explain phenomena.

### What is literature

Formal definitions of literature from various perspectives:

**Traditional Perspective**: 
   - Literature is defined as *written works* that are considered to have artistic or intellectual *value*, often characterized by creative or imaginative expression. This includes poetry, prose, drama, and essays that reflect cultural and emotional themes.
   - Example: "Literature is the expression of *thoughts and emotions* through language, offering a reflection of society and the human experience." – Adapted from Matthew Arnold.

**Linguistic Perspective**: 
   - Literature is the use of language in an artistic and stylized manner, focusing on elements such as rhythm, meter, symbolism, and narrative techniques that go beyond mere communication to evoke aesthetic pleasure or profound meaning.
   - Example: "Literature represents language molded in ways that communicate not only information but emotion, beauty, and rhythm." – Noam Chomsky (paraphrased).

**Cultural Perspective**: 
   - Literature is a mirror of culture, encapsulating the beliefs, values, customs, and historical experiences of a society. It serves as a repository and transmitter of cultural identity.
   - Example: "Literature acts as a cultural artifact, recording the essence of a people’s heritage and their journey through time." – Edward Said.

**Philosophical Perspective**: 
   - Literature is a medium for exploring the fundamental questions of existence, morality, and human nature. It often delves into abstract themes such as love, justice, truth, and the meaning of life.
   - Example: "Literature is a critical exploration of life’s deepest truths, offering readers a lens through which to examine their existence." – Jean-Paul Sartre.

**Postmodern Perspective**: 
   
   - Literature is seen as a construct, deconstructing traditional narratives, questioning the nature of truth, and often blending genres and styles to challenge conventional boundaries.
   - Example: "Literature is not a fixed form but a dynamic process, challenging readers to rethink preconceived notions about reality and meaning." – Jacques Derrida.

**Psychological Perspective**: 
   - Literature serves as an exploration of the human psyche, capturing the inner workings of the mind and emotional experiences, often providing insight into individual and collective behaviors.
   - Example: "Literature provides a window into the complexities of the human mind, reflecting our fears, desires, and dreams." – Sigmund Freud.

**Sociological Perspective**: 
   - Literature is a social product that reflects and critiques societal structures, relationships, and dynamics. It often addresses issues such as power, class, and inequality.
   - Example: "Literature is a tool for understanding and challenging the social constructs that define human interactions and institutions." – Karl Marx.



### What is reading

From the perspective of hermeneutics, the problem has trasformed into:
  1. How does the reading get done?
  2. How do we form the conclusion that we are interpreting something adequately, that we have a basis for the kind of reading that we're doing?
  3. What is the reading experience like?
  4. how do we meet the text face-to-face.

> `Hermeneutics` [ˌhɜːməˈnjuːtɪks] is the theory and methodology of interpretation, particularly the interpretation of texts, language, and symbolic expressions. It originated as a discipline focused on interpreting religious texts, especially the Bible, but has since expanded to encompass a broader range of disciplines, including philosophy, law, and social sciences. The goal of hermeneutics is to understand the meaning of texts or phenomena in their context, considering factors such as historical background, cultural influences, and the intentions of the author or creator. Key figures in the development of hermeneutics include Friedrich Schleiermacher, Wilhelm Dilthey, and Hans-Georg Gadamer.  
> Hermeneutics is centered around several essential ideas:
> 1. **Interpretation**: At its core, hermeneutics is concerned with understanding and interpreting texts, symbols, or actions, especially in their cultural, historical, and philosophical contexts.
> 2. **Understanding the Whole and the Parts**: One of the fundamental concepts in hermeneutics is the "`hermeneutic circle`." This idea suggests that *understanding a part of a text or phenomenon is dependent on understanding the whole, and understanding the whole requires understanding its parts*. Interpretation is a continuous *back-and-forth process* between the parts and the whole.
> 3. **Contextuality**: Meaning is not static and is always shaped by the context in which it appears. Hermeneutics emphasizes the importance of historical, cultural, and social contexts in interpreting meaning.
> 4. **Prejudices and Biases**: Hermeneutic theorists, especially Hans-Georg Gadamer, have emphasized that interpretation is influenced by the interpreter's own prejudices, preconceptions, and historical situatedness. Understanding these influences is crucial to interpreting meaning more authentically.
> 5. **Dialogue and Fusion of Horizons**: Gadamer introduced the concept of the "fusion of horizons," which suggests that understanding occurs when the interpreter's perspective ("horizon") interacts with the perspective of the text or other cultural artifact. This process leads to a shared understanding through dialogue between the past and present.
> 6. **The Role of the Interpreter**: Hermeneutics recognizes that the interpreter plays an active role in creating meaning, not just passively uncovering it. The interpreter's background, experiences, and assumptions shape how they understand texts or phenomena.
> 7. **Application**: Hermeneutics is not just about understanding meaning in the past; it also involves applying that understanding to contemporary issues. Interpretation can lead to new insights, changes in perspectives, and transformative actions in society.

### How does Literary Theory relate to the history of criticism

Similarity:
   1. They are both concerned with the **definition** of literature.

Difference:
   1. Literary Theory is NOT concerned with issues of evaluation, conconmitant issues of appreciation.
   2. Literary Theory is skeptical about the foundations of its subject matter. see: [#modernity-and-literature](#modernity-and-literature)



### What is an author

**Foucault**: It is not that there's no such thing as an author but that it's rather dangerous to believe that there are authors.

## Hermeneutic Circle in Literary Theory

### Modernity and literature

In the classical era, people believed that they could directly possess reason and directly understand things themselves. Texts  are able to straightforwardly describe nature, mind, emotion, truth and human beings.

**Modernity and skepticism**: consciousness is not real, the feeling of alive no longer involves angecy. The things we can do are limited, and this limitation arises from the way consciousness is determined in ways we cannot control or transcend.

   1. **Descartes**: *the distance between the mind and the things exists*, which is benificial for cognition.
   2. **Kant**: *the thing in itself cannot be known by people*, but we can sort of triangulate it and come to terms with it obliquely.
   3. **Hegel**: We have "unhappy consciousness,", which is the result of estrangement(Verfremdung), and which drives us too far away from the thing that we're looking at. We are no longer certain at all of what we're looking at. It's also that *consciousness is alienated from its own underpinnings, that it doesn't have any clear sense of where it's coming from*.
   4. **Marx**: social, historical and economic factors that determine the way what we think, i.e. "ideology". *Ideology is driven by factors **beyond the ken of the person** who thinks ideologically*. Consciousness, that is to say the way in which we believe things, is determined by factors outside its control. 
   5. **Nietszche**: the distortion of truth is caused by language. Language itself is no longer a truth serum, but obsolete metaphors, metonymies, anthropomorphisms. *The nature of language, and the way language is received by us, in turn determines what we can do with it, which is to say it determines what we think*.
   6. **Freud**: *consciousness is never completely uninhibited*, never completely does and says what it wants to say. So the spin on consciousness for Freud is the unconscious.
   7. **Darwin**: sociobiology is a way of thinking that transcends consciousness.

Due to the influence of these figures, opponents of Literary Theory widely recognize it as the `"hermeneutics of suspicion"`.

**Review of Paul Ricoeur:**

   These great precursors of modern thought together dominate a "school of suspicion". whatever seems manifest or obvious or patent in what we are looking at is undermined for this kind of mind by a `negation` which is counterintuitive: this means that this negation is not just a partial correction of our understanding of things, but a complete overturn of it.

**An individual's summary:**
   
   Literary Theory is negation and suspicion of literary works.

> `oblique` [əˈbliːk]: adj. 1. not expressing something directly 2. not looking or pointing directly at someone or something 3. an oblique line is sloping 4. an oblique angle is any angle that is not 90°, 180°, or 270°  
> `obsolete` [ˈɒbsəliːt]：adj. 1. no longer used because of being replaced by something newer and more effective  
> `metaphors`: A metaphor is a figure of speech in which one thing is described as being something else, to highlight similarities between the two.  
> `metonymies`: Metonymy is a figure of speech where something is referred to by the name of something closely associated with it, rather than by its own name.  
> `anthropomorphisms`: Anthropomorphism involves attributing human characteristics, emotions, or behaviors to non-human entities, such as animals, objects, or gods.  
> `agency = subjectivity`: 
>  - In literature, subjectivity refers to the representation of personal perspectives, emotions, and inner thoughts of characters. It allows readers to see the world through a character's eyes, understanding their emotional responses, beliefs, and motivations.
>  - Agency in philosophy refers to the capacity of individuals to act independently, make choices, and shape their own destinies. It is the ability to exercise control over one's actions and decisions, often in the face of external forces such as social, cultural, or economic constraints

## Transcript

### Lecture 1 Chapter 5: Literary Theory and the History of Modern Criticism

Now the question, "How does Literary Theory relate to the history of criticism?" That is a course that I like to teach, too; usually I teach Plato to T.S. Eliot or Plato to I.A. Richards or some other important figure in the early twentieth century. It's a course which is absolutely fascinating in all sorts of ways, and it has one very important thing in common with Literary Theory: that is to say, literary criticism is, too, perpetually concerned with the definition of literature. Many of the issues that I raised in talking about defining literature are as relevant for literary criticism as they are for Literary Theory, and yet we all instinctively know that these are two very different enterprises. Literary Theory loses something that literary criticism just takes for granted. Literary Theory is not concerned with issues of evaluation, and it's not really concerned with concomitant issues of appreciation. Literary Theory just takes those for granted as part of the sense experience, as one might say, of any reader and prefers, rather, to dwell on questions of description, analysis and speculation, as I've said. So that's what's lost in theory, but what's new in theory? Here I come to the topic which will occupy most of my attention for the remainder of the lecture. What's new in theory is the element of skepticism that literary criticism by and large-- which is usually affirming a canon of some sort-- doesn't reflect. Literary Theory, as I say, is skeptical about the foundations of its subject matter and also, in many cases, about the foundations of what it itself is doing. So the question is: how on earth did this come about? It's an historical question, as I say, and I want to devote the rest of the lecture to it. Why should doubt about the veridical or truth-affirming possibilities of interpretation be so widespread in the twentieth century? Now here is a big glop of intellectual history. I think the sort of skepticism I mean arises from what one might call and what often is called modernity-- not to be confused with Modernism, an early twentieth-century phenomenon, but the history of modern thought as it usually derives from the generation of Descartes, Shakespeare, and Cervantes. Notice something about all of those figures: Shakespeare is preoccupied with figures who may or may not be crazy. Cervantes is preoccupied with a figure who is crazy--we're pretty sure of that, but he certainly isn't. He takes it for granted that he is the most rational and systematic of all thinkers and raises questions about-- since we all take ourselves to be rational too-- raises questions about just how we know ourselves not to be paranoid delusives like Don Quixote. So that can be unsettling when we think of this as happening at a certain contemporaneous moment in the history of thought. 

现在的问题是：“文学理论如何与批评史相关？”这是我也喜欢教授的课程；通常我会从柏拉图讲到T.S.艾略特，或者从柏拉图讲到I.A.理查兹，或者其他一些二十世纪初的重要人物。这是一门非常迷人的课程，在许多方面都很有趣，而且它与文学理论有一个非常重要的共同点：那就是，文学批评同样也一直在关注文学的定义。我在讨论定义文学时提出的许多问题，对于文学批评和文学理论来说都是一样相关的，然而我们都本能地知道，这两者是截然不同的工作。文学理论失去了一些文学批评所理所当然认为的东西。文学理论不关心评价的问题，也不太关心欣赏的相关问题。文学理论将这些问题视为任何读者的感知体验的一部分，而更倾向于关注描述、分析和推测等问题，正如我所说的。所以这是理论中失去的东西，但理论中又有什么新东西呢？在这里，我要进入接下来讲座的大部分内容。理论中的新东西是怀疑主义的元素，而文学批评通常会确认某种规范，这一点没有体现。正如我所说，文学理论对其主题的基础持怀疑态度，而且在很多情况下，对于它自身所做的事情的基础也持怀疑态度。那么问题来了：这一切是如何发生的？这是一个历史性的问题，正如我所说，我想把讲座的剩余部分都用来讨论这个问题。为什么在二十世纪，怀疑解释的真实性或真理性可能性会如此普遍？在这里，我想讲述一段知识史。我认为，我所说的这种怀疑主义来自于通常被称为**现代性**的一种思维方式——这与现代主义（一个二十世纪初的现象）不同，而是指源自笛卡尔、莎士比亚和塞万提斯时代的现代思想历史。注意一下这些人物的共同点：莎士比亚关注的是那些可能理智，也可能疯狂的人物；塞万提斯关注的是一个明显疯狂的人物——我们几乎可以肯定他是疯的，但他显然不是。他理所当然地认为自己是最理性、最系统的思想者，并提出了问题——因为我们都认为自己是理性的——提出了我们如何知道自己不是像唐吉诃德那样的偏执妄想者的问题。所以，当我们把这些问题与思想历史的某一特定时刻联系在一起时，这可能会让我们感到不安。

Now Descartes, you remember, in his Meditations begins by asking a series of questions about how we can know anything, and one of the skeptical questions he asks is, "Well, might I not be crazy?" In other words, Descartes is still thinking along these same lines. He says, "Well, maybe I've been seized by an evil genius of some kind or maybe I'm just crazy." Now why--and here is the question--why do we get this nervousness about the relationship between what I know and how I know it arising at this moment? Well, I think it's characterized at least in part by what Descartes goes on to say in his Meditations. Descartes settles the matter--perhaps somewhat sweeping the question of whether he is crazy under the rug because I'm still not sure he answers that question-- but he settles the matter famously by saying, "I think. Therefore, I am," and furthermore, as a concomitant, "I think, therefore, all the things that I'm thinking about can be understood to exist as well." Now the Cartesian Revolution establishes something that is absolutely crucial for what we call the Enlightenment of the next hundred, hundred and fifty years--in other words, the idea that there is a distance between the mind and the things that it thinks about, but that this distance is a good thing. In other words, if you look too closely at a picture or if you stand too far away from it you don't see it clearly-- it's out of focus--but if you achieve just the right distance from it, it comes into focus. The idea of scientific objectivity, the idea that motivates the creation of the great Encyclopedia by the figures of the French Enlightenment-- this idea all arises out of the idea that there is a certain appropriate objective distance between the perceiver and the perceived. Gradually, however, the idea that this distance is not too great begins to erode so that in 1796 Kant, who isn't exactly enlisted on the side of the skeptics by most of his serious students, nevertheless does say something equally famous as that which Descartes said and a good deal more disturbing: "We cannot know the thing in itself." Now as I said, Kant erected such an incredibly magnificent scaffolding around the thing in itself-- that is to say, the variety of ways in which although we can't know it, we can sort of triangulate it and come to terms with it obliquely-- that it seems churlish to enlist him on the side of the skeptics, but at the same time there's a sense of a danger in the distance between subject and object that begins to emerge in thinking of this kind. Now by 1807, Hegel in The Phenomenology of Mind is saying that in recent history and in recent developments of consciousness something unfortunate has set in. We have "unhappy consciousness," unhappy consciousness which is the result of estrangement, or Verfremdung, and which drives us too far away from the thing that we're looking at. We are no longer certain at all of what we're looking at, and consciousness, therefore, feels alienated. All right. So you can already begin to see a development in intellectual history that perhaps opens the way to a certain skepticism. But the crucial thing hasn't yet happened, because after all, in all of these accounts, even that of Hegel, there is no doubt about the authority of consciousness to think what it thinks. It may not clearly think about things, about objects, but it has a kind of legitimate basis that generates the sort of thinking that it does. But then--and here is where I want you to look at the passages that I've handed out. Here's where three great figures--there are others but these are considered the seminal figures-- begin to raise questions which complicate the whole issue of consciousness. Their argument is that it's not just that consciousness doesn't clearly understand what it's looking at and is therefore alienated from it. It's also that consciousness is alienated from its own underpinnings, that it doesn't have any clear sense of where it's coming from any more than what it's looking at: in other words, that consciousness is not only estranged from the world but that it is in and of itself inauthentic. So just quickly look at these passages. 

你记得笛卡尔在《沉思》中开始提出一系列关于我们如何知道任何事情的问题，其中一个怀疑性的问题是，“我难道不是疯了吗？”换句话说，笛卡尔仍然在沿着这些思路思考。他说，“也许我被某种邪恶的天才控制，或者我可能只是疯了。”那么，问题是——为什么在这个时刻，我们会对自己所知道的东西与我们如何知道它之间的关系产生这种焦虑呢？我认为这至少在部分上可以通过笛卡尔在《沉思》中接下来所说的内容来说明。笛卡尔解决了这个问题——也许他在某种程度上把是否自己疯了的问题搁置一边，因为我仍然不确定他是否真正回答了这个问题——但他著名地通过说，“我思故我在”来解决问题，进一步说，“我思，因此，我所思考的所有事物也可以被理解为存在的。”笛卡尔革命建立了一个对接下来一百到一百五十年间所谓启蒙时代至关重要的思想——换句话说，就是*思想与它所思考的事物之间有一定距离，而这个距离是有益的*。换句话说，如果你离一幅画太近，或者站得太远，你就看不清楚——它会变得模糊——但如果你达到恰到好处的距离，它就会变得清晰。科学客观性的理念，激发了法国启蒙时代人物编写伟大百科全书的理念——这一切都源自于这样一个观点：*感知者和被感知者之间有一种适当的客观距离*。然而，随着时间的推移，*认为这个距离并不太大的观念开始逐渐被侵蚀*，直到1796年，康德在大多数严肃学者看来并不完全是怀疑主义者的阵营中，却仍然提出了与笛卡尔同样著名但更加令人不安的话：“*我们无法认识事物本身*。”正如我所说，康德围绕事物本身建立了如此宏伟的框架——也就是说，*尽管我们无法直接认识它，但我们可以通过某种方式间接地接触它、理解它*——因此把他归类为怀疑主义者似乎有些过于苛刻，但与此同时，事物和主体之间的这种距离感开始在这种思维中显现出一种危险感。到了1807年，黑格尔在《精神现象学》中说，在最近的历史和意识发展的过程中，出现了一种不幸的现象。我们有了“`痛苦的意识`”，这种*痛苦的意识是由于疏离，或称为“疏远”（Verfremdung），它使我们过于远离我们所关注的事物。我们已经完全不确定自己在看什么，因此意识感到疏离*。好吧，你已经可以开始看到在思想史上有一种可能通向某种怀疑主义的思想发展。但至关重要的事情还没有发生，因为在所有这些叙述中，*即使是黑格尔的叙述，也没有对意识思考它所思考的事物的权威产生怀疑*。它可能不能清晰地思考事物和对象，但它有一种**合法的基础**来生成它所做的那种思考。然而，接下来——这是我希望你们看一下我分发给你们的这些段落的地方。这里，三位伟大的思想家——虽然还有其他人，但这些被认为是开创性的思想家——开始提出一些问题，这些问题使整个意识的问题变得复杂起来。他们的论点是，*不仅仅是意识不能清楚地理解它所看到的东西，因此与它产生疏离感，还在于意识与其自身的根基产生了疏离，它再也不清楚自己来自哪里，就像它看不清自己所看到的东西一样*。换句话说，*意识不仅仅是与世界疏远，它本身也变得不真实*。所以，快速看一下这些段落。

Marx, in the famous argument about commodity fetishism in Kapital, is comparing the way in which we take the product of human labor and turn it into a commodity by saying that it has objective value, by saying that we know what its value is in and of itself. He compares that with religion. The argument is: well, God is a product of human labor. In other words, it's not a completely supercilious argument, sort of "God is brought into being the same way objects that we make use of are brought into being." God is a product of human labor, but then we turn around and we say God exists independently and has value objectively. Marx's argument is that the two forms of belief, belief in the objective value of the commodity and belief in God, are the same. Now whether or not any of this is true, believe me, is neither here nor there. The point that Marx is making is that consciousness, that is to say the way in which we believe things, is determined by factors outside its control-- that is to say in the case of Marx's arguments, social, historical and economic factors that determine what we think and which in general we call "ideology"; that is to say, ideology is driven by factors beyond the ken of the person who thinks ideologically. So you see the problem for consciousness now is not just a single problem. It's twofold: its inauthentic relationship with the things it looks at and also its inauthentic relationship with its own underpinnings. The argument is exactly the same for Nietzsche, only he shifts the ground of attack. For Nietzsche, the underpinnings of consciousness which make the operations of consciousness inauthentic are the nature of language itself. That is to say that when we think we're telling the truth we're actually using worn-out figures of speech. "What then is truth? A mobile army of metaphors, metonymies, anthropomorphisms--in short, a sum of human relations which became poetically and rhetorically intensified," etc., etc., etc., "and are now no longer of account as coins but are debased." Now that word "now" is very important. It suggests that Nietzsche does somehow believe that there's a privileged moment in the history of language when perhaps language is a truth serum, when it is capable of telling the truth, but language has now simply become a question of worn-out figures, all of which dictates what we believe to be true. I speak in a figurative way about the relationship between the earth and the sky, and I believe that there's a sky god. I move from speech to belief because I simply don't believe that I'm using figures of speech. All of this is implied in Nietzsche's argument. In other words, language, the nature of language, and the way language is received by us, in turn determines what we can do with it, which is to say it determines what we think, so that for Nietzsche the distortion of truth-- that is to say the distortion of the power to observe in consciousness-- has as its underlying cause language, the state of language, the status of language. Freud finally argues for exactly the same relationship between consciousness-- that is to say, what I think I am thinking from minute to minute-- and the unconscious, which perpetually in one way or another unsettles what I'm thinking and saying from minute to minute. You know that in The Psychopathology of Everyday Life, Freud reminded us that the Freudian slip isn't something that happens just sometimes-- and nobody knows this better than an ad libbing lecturer-- ;it's something that happens all the time. The Freudian slip is something that one lives with simply as a phenomenon of the slippage of consciousness under the influence of the unconscious. Now in the passage I gave you, Freud says a very interesting thing, which is that after all, we have absolutely no objective evidence that the unconscious exists. If I could see the unconscious, it'd be conscious. Right. The unconscious, Freud is saying, is something that we have to infer from the way consciousness operates. We've got to infer something. We've got to figure out somehow how it is that consciousness is never completely uninhibited, never completely does and says what it wants to say. So the spin on consciousness for Freud is the unconscious.

马克思在《资本论》中关于商品拜物教的著名论述中，比较了我们如何通过说一个物品具有客观价值，将它从人类劳动的产物转变为商品，称其“有内在的价值”。他将这一点与宗教做了比较。论点是：神是人类劳动的产物。换句话说，这并不是一个完全高傲的论点，像是“神的存在方式和我们使用的物品一样，是由我们创造出来的。”神是人类劳动的产物，但接着我们转过头来又说神是独立存在的，并且具有客观价值。马克思的论点是，信仰商品的客观价值和信仰神的信仰形式是相同的。至于这些是否真实，相信我，这并不重要。马克思要表达的重点是：*意识，也就是说我们信仰的方式，是由它无法控制的外部因素决定的*——在马克思的论述中，这些外部因素是*社会、历史和经济因素*，它们决定了我们思考的内容，我们通常称之为“`意识形态`”；也就是说，*意识形态是由那些**超出思考者**认知的因素推动的*。因此，你现在可以看到，*意识的问题不再是单一的问题，而是双重的：它与它所看到的事物之间的关系是不真实的，同时它与自身的基础之间的关系也是不真实的*。尼采的论点完全相同，只不过他改变了攻击的角度。对于尼采而言，导致意识运作不真实的基础是*语言本身的性质*。也就是说，当我们以为自己在讲真话时，实际上我们在使用陈旧的比喻。“那么，真理是什么呢？一个流动的隐喻、转喻、拟人化的军队——简言之，一系列的人类关系，这些关系在诗意和修辞上被强化，”等等，“现在不再作为硬币的价值存在，而是已经贬值。”这里的“现在”非常重要。它暗示了尼采确实认为，*在语言的历史中有一个特殊的时刻，当时语言或许是一种能够表达真理的“真理药水”，能够讲出真话，但如今语言仅仅是陈腐的比喻问题，这些比喻支配着我们认为真实的内容*。我以一种比喻的方式讲述地球与天空的关系，而我相信有一位天神。我从语言过渡到信仰，因为我根本不认为自己在使用比喻。所有这一切都包含在尼采的论点中。换句话说，*语言的性质，以及我们如何接收语言，反过来决定了我们能用它做什么，也就是说，它决定了我们思考的内容*，因此对于尼采而言，真理的扭曲——即意识中观察能力的扭曲——有其根本原因是语言，语言的状态，语言的地位。最终，弗洛伊德也提出了意识与潜意识之间完全相同的关系——也就是说，我认为自己正在思考的内容和潜意识，它不断以某种方式扰乱我从一分钟到一分钟的思考和言语。你们知道，在《日常生活的精神病理学》中，弗洛伊德提醒我们，弗洛伊德式的口误并不是偶尔发生的——没有人比即兴讲座的讲师更明白这一点——它是一个时时发生的现象。弗洛伊德式口误是我们生活中存在的现象，意识在潜意识的影响下不断滑动。现在在我给你们的段落中，弗洛伊德说了一个非常有趣的话题，他指出，毕竟我们没有任何客观证据证明潜意识的存在。如果我能看到潜意识，那它就会是意识的了。对，弗洛伊德在说，潜意识是我们必须从意识的运作中推断出来的。我们必须推断某些东西。*我们得搞清楚，为什么意识从来不是完全不受限制的，它从来不能完全做和说它想说的任何事情。因此，对于弗洛伊德来说，意识的角度就是潜意识*。


### Lecture 1 Chapter 6 The Hermeneutics of Suspicion

Now someone who didn't fully believe Marx, Nietzsche and Freud, a very important modern philosopher in the hermeneutic tradition named Paul Ricoeur, famously said in the fourth passage on your sheet that these great precursors of modern thought-- and particularly, I would immediately add, of modern Literary Theory--together dominate a "school of suspicion." There is in other words in Ricoeur's view a hermeneutics of suspicion, and "skepticism" or "suspicion" is a word that can also be appropriated perhaps more rigorously for philosophy as negativity. That is to say, whatever seems manifest or obvious or patent in what we are looking at is undermined for this kind of mind by a negation which is counterintuitive: that is to say, which would seem not just to qualify what we understand ourselves to be looking at but to undermine it altogether. And these tendencies in the way in which Marx, Nietzsche and Freud have been received have been tremendously influential. When we read Foucault's "What is an Author?" next time we'll return to this question of how Marx, Nietzsche and Freud have been received and what we should make of that in view of Foucault's idea that-- well, not that there's no such thing as an author but that it's rather dangerous to believe that there are authors. So if it's dangerous to believe that there are authors, what about Marx, Nietzsche and Freud? Foucault confronts this question in "What is an Author?" and gives us some interesting results of his thinking. For us, the aftermath even precisely of the passages I have just quoted, but certainly of the oeuvre of the three authors I have quoted from, can to a large degree be understood as accounting for our topic-- the phenomenon of Literary Theory as we study it. In other words, Literary Theory, because of the influence of these figures, is to a considerable degree a hermeneutics of suspicion recognized as such both by its proponents and famously-- I think this is perhaps what is historically remote for you-- by its enemies. During the same period when I was first teaching this course, a veritable six-foot shelf of diatribes against Literary Theory was being written in the public sphere. You can take or leave Literary Theory, fine, but the idea that there would be such an incredible outcry against it was one of the most fascinating results of it. That is to say for many, many, many people Literary Theory had something to do with the end of civilization as we know it. That's one of the things that seems rather strange to us today from an historical perspective: that the undermining of foundational knowledge which seemed to be part and parcel of so much that went on in Literary Theory was seen as the central crucial threat to rationality emanating from the academy and was attacked in those terms in, as I say, at least six feet of lively polemics. All of that is the legacy of Literary Theory, and as I say, it arises in part from the element of skepticism that I thought it best to emphasize today. 

现在，有一位并不完全相信马克思、尼采和弗洛伊德的现代哲学家，名叫保罗·里科尔，他在你们手中的第四段中有一句著名的话，认为这些现代思想的伟大先驱——特别是我会立即补充，*现代文学理论的伟大先驱——共同主导了一个“怀疑的学派”*。换句话说，在里科尔看来，存在一种“怀疑的诠释学”，*而“怀疑”或“怀疑主义”也许可以更严格地作为哲学中的“否定性”来理解*。也就是说，*任何看似显而易见、显然或显著的事物*，对于这种思维方式的人来说，*都会被一种反直觉的否定所削弱*：*这意味着，这种否定不仅仅是对我们理解的事物进行某种程度的修正，而是完全颠覆它*。这种马克思、尼采和弗洛伊德的接受方式产生了巨大的影响。当我们下次阅读福柯的《什么是作者？》时，我们将回到这个问题，讨论马克思、尼采和弗洛伊德是如何被接受的，以及我们应该如何理解福柯关于“并非没有作者”而是认为相信有作者是危险的这一观点。如果相信有作者是危险的，那么马克思、尼采和弗洛伊德又该如何看待呢？福柯在《什么是作者？》中面对这个问题，并给出了他有趣的思考结果。对于我们而言，正是正如我刚刚引用的段落所表明的，甚至更准确地说，是这三位作者的作品，至大程度上可以理解为我们今天研究文学理论这一现象的根源。换句话说，*文学理论，正是由于这些人物的影响*，在很大程度上是一种被其倡导者以及——我想这可能是你们历史上较为陌生的——*其敌人都公认为的“怀疑的诠释学”*。在我第一次讲授这门课程的同一时期，一大堆对文学理论的激烈抨击文章在公众领域内写成。你可以选择接受或不接受文学理论，没问题，但认为会有如此强烈的反对，正是其最令人着迷的结果之一。也就是说，对于许多人来说，文学理论与文明的终结紧密相关，这是我们今天从历史角度看时感到颇为奇怪的一点：*文学理论中对基础性知识的颠覆，似乎是直接威胁到理性的一股来自学术界的力量，并且被以此为中心进行激烈抨击*，正如我所说，至少有六英尺的抨击篇幅。这一切是文学理论的遗产，正如我所说，它部分源于我今天想强调的怀疑主义元素。

Now I think that one thing Ricoeur leaves out, and something that we can anticipate as becoming more and more important for Literary Theory and other kinds of theory in the twenty-first century, is Darwin. That is to say, it strikes me that Darwin could very easily be considered a fourth hermeneut of suspicion. Of course, Darwin was not interested in suspicion but he was certainly the founder of ways of thinking about consciousness that are determined, socio-biologically determined: determined in the realm of cognitive science, determined as artificial intelligence, and so on. All of this is Darwinian thinking and, I think, increasingly will be central in importance in the twenty-first century. What will alter the shape of Literary Theory as it was known and studied in the twentieth century is, I think, an increasing emphasis on cognitive science and socio-biological approaches both to literature and to interpretive processes that will derive from Darwin in the same way that strands of thinking of the twentieth century derive from the three figures that I've mentioned. But what all this gives rise to--and this brings me finally to the passages which you have on both sides of your sheet and which I don't want to take up today but just to preview-- the passages from Henry James' Ambassadors from 1903, and from Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard from 1904. In other words, I am at pains to remind you that this is a specific historical moment in which, in a variety of ways, in each case the speaker argues that consciousness-- that is to say, the feeling of being alive and being someone acting in the world-- no longer involves agency: the feeling that somehow to be conscious has become to be a puppet, that there is a limitation on what we can do, imposed by the idea that consciousness is determined in ways that we cannot control and cannot get the better of, so that Strether in The Ambassadors and Yepihodov in The Cherry Orchard speak for a point of view which is a kind of partially well-informed gloom and doom that could be understood to anticipate texts that are much better informed, that we will be considering but nevertheless are especially important as an aspect of their historical moment. I want to begin the next lecture by taking up those passages. Please do bring them, and I will also be passing around Tony the Tow Truck and I'll give you a brief description of what the little children's book actually looks like, and then we will plunge in to the question "What is an author?" So I'll see you on Thursday.

现在，我认为里科尔忽略了一点，或者说我认为这点在二十一世纪的文学理论及其他种类的理论中将变得越来越重要，那就是达尔文。也就是说，我认为达尔文完全可以被视为第四个“怀疑的诠释者”。当然，达尔文并不关注怀疑，但他无疑是*思考意识的一种方式的创始人，这种方式是由社会生物学决定的*：在认知科学领域、在人工智能领域等方面都有他的影响。所有这些思维方式都是达尔文主义的，我认为它们将在二十一世纪变得越来越重要。改变二十世纪文学理论的面貌的，将是对认知科学和社会生物学方法的日益重视，这些方法不仅适用于文学，也适用于解释过程，就像二十世纪的思想流派源自我提到的三位人物一样。所有这些都会引发——这将是我最后要提到的内容——你们手上纸张两边的段落，我今天不想详细讲解，但想简单预览一下——这些段落来自亨利·詹姆斯的《大使》1903年版和契诃夫的《樱桃园》1904年版。换句话说，我要提醒你们，*这正是一个特定的历史时刻，在这个时刻，讲话者以各种方式论述了意识——也就是说，活着并在世界上行动的感觉——不再涉及主体性：意识仿佛已经成为木偶，感觉到我们能够做的事受到限制，这种限制源自于意识以我们无法控制和超越的方式被决定*，因而《大使》中的斯特雷瑟和《樱桃园》中的耶皮霍多夫都表达了一种*部分知情的悲观情绪*，这种情绪可以被理解为预测了更为深刻的文本，虽然它们并不完全符合，但无疑是它们所处历史时刻的重要组成部分。我希望在下次讲座开始时讨论这些段落，请带来这些段落，我还会发放《托尼拖车》这本小书，并简要描述这本儿童书的样子，接着我们将深入探讨“什么是作者？”这一问题。到时见！
