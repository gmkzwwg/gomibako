## Historical Divisions

#### I) Continent-level historical divisions of Europe (with dynastic pivots)

| European regime (approx.)                                                  | Structural division of Europe                                                                                                     | Dynastic/imperial pivots (examples)                                                                                                           |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Classical Mediterranean system (c. 146 BCE–476 CE West)**                | Rome integrates the Mediterranean + much of Western/Central Europe; frontier zones beyond Rhine–Danube                            | Roman imperial dynasties (Julio-Claudian → Flavian → Antonine → Severan, etc.); **Constantinian** turn and Christian empire (4th c.)          |
| **Late Antiquity & post-Roman successor worlds (c. 4th–8th c.)**           | 3 cores: **Latin West**, **Greek East (Byzantium)**, **Islamic Mediterranean** (after 7th c.); migration-era kingdoms in the West | West: **Merovingians** (Franks), Visigoths, Lombards; East: **Justinianic** and later **Heraclian** dynastic eras; Iberia: Umayyad al-Andalus |
| **Carolingian–Ottonian re-imperialization (c. 8th–11th c.)**               | Latin Christendom consolidates; imperial idea revived in West; frontier expansion (Vikings, Slavs, steppe)                        | **Carolingians** (Frankish empire) → division; **Ottonians** (imperial revival in East Frankish/German realm)                                 |
| **High Medieval “Latin Christendom” (c. 1050–1300)**                       | Western/central Europe organized by feudal monarchies + papal/imperial rivalry; Crusading frontier; Byzantium still major in East | Capetian rise in France; Norman/Plantagenet England; **Komnenoi** (Byzantium)                                                                 |
| **Late Medieval crisis & state-building (c. 1300–1500)**                   | Demographic shock (plague), fiscal-military states; “national” monarchies; Ottoman expansion into SE Europe                       | France: **Valois** consolidation; England: **Lancastrian/Yorkist** conflict; Byzantium: **Palaiologoi** decline; **Ottoman** rise             |
| **Confessional Europe & early modern composite monarchies (c. 1500–1648)** | Europe split into Catholic/Protestant confessional blocs; global empires; balance-of-power diplomacy                              | **Habsburg** hegemony (Spain/Austria branches); Tudor–Stuart Britain; Bourbon–Habsburg rivalry; Thirty Years’ War ends 1648                   |
| **Absolutist–Enlightenment balance-of-power (c. 1648–1789)**               | Multi-state equilibrium; centralized monarchies; colonial–commercial competition                                                  | France: **Bourbons**; Austria: **Habsburg(-Lorraine)**; Prussia: **Hohenzollern**; Russia: **Romanov**                                        |
| **Revolutionary–Napoleonic rupture (1789–1815)**                           | Dynastic legitimacy challenged by popular sovereignty; mass conscription; export of legal-administrative models                   | French monarchy falls; Napoleon’s imperial experiment; Vienna settlement restores dynastic order (temporarily)                                |
| **National–industrial Europe (1815–1914)**                                 | Nation-state ideology + industrial capitalism; unifications; imperialism; mass politics                                           | Italy: Savoy unification; Germany: **Hohenzollern** imperial Germany (1871); Habsburg and Romanov empires strained                            |
| **Total war, empire collapse, ideological blocs (1914–1991)**              | 1914–1945 destroys old dynastic empires; 1945–1991 Cold War divides Europe (NATO vs Warsaw Pact)                                  | End of **Habsburg**, **Hohenzollern**, **Romanov**, **Ottoman**; later communist regimes in the East                                          |
| **Post–Cold War Europe (1991– )**                                          | EU enlargement/integration vs renewed security competition; most states are republics or constitutional monarchies                | Remaining dynasties function symbolically (Windsor, Bourbon Spain, Scandinavian houses, etc.)                                                 |

#### II) Dynastic sequences by major European regions (rise/fall included)

##### A) France (core dynastic chain of the Western monarchy)

* **Merovingian** (c. 5th–751) → **Carolingian** (751–987)
* **Capetian** (987–1328) → **Valois** (1328–1589) → **Bourbon** (1589–1792; restored 1814–1830)
* **Orléans** (July Monarchy 1830–1848) → republics thereafter (with the Second Empire under Bonaparte 1852–1870)

##### B) England/Britain (key for the Atlantic/world shift)

* **Wessex** (10th–11th c.; disrupted 1013–1042 by Danish rule)
* **Norman** (1066–1154) → **Plantagenet** (1154–1399)
* **Lancaster** (1399–1461) ↔ **York** (1461–1485)
* **Tudor** (1485–1603) → **Stuart** (1603–1714; interrupted 1649–1660 republic)
* **Hanover** (1714–1901) → **Saxe-Coburg and Gotha** (1901–1917) → **Windsor** (1917–present)

##### C) Iberia (Spain/Portugal: Reconquista to global empires)

**Spain (Castile/Aragon → unified monarchy):**

* Castile: **Trastámara** (1369–1504) → Habsburg Spain (1516–1700) → **Bourbon** (1700–present, with interruptions)
  **Portugal:**
* **Burgundy** (12th–14th c.) → **Aviz** (1385–1580) → Iberian Union under Spanish Habsburgs (1580–1640) → **Braganza** (1640–1910)

##### D) Holy Roman Empire / Germany (imperial legitimacy + later national unification)

**Holy Roman imperial dynastic phases (selected):**

* **Ottonian** (10th c.) → **Salian** (11th–12th c.) → **Hohenstaufen** (12th–13th c.)
* Interregnum → **Luxembourg** (14th–15th c.) → long **Habsburg** predominance (15th c.–1806)
  **Germany (nation-state era):**
* Prussia: **Hohenzollern** rise → German Empire under **Hohenzollern** (1871–1918) → republics thereafter

##### E) Austria/Habsburg lands (the classic “composite monarchy”)

* **Habsburg** as major European house (late medieval rise; imperial predominance 15th c.–1806; Habsburg monarchy to 1918)
* **Habsburg-Lorraine** (from mid-18th c. through 1918 as the reigning line)

##### F) Russia (dynastic empire → revolutionary collapse)

* **Rurikid** (c. 9th c.–1598)
* Time of Troubles (interregnum) → **Romanov** (1613–1917) → Soviet and post-Soviet state forms

##### G) Byzantium (Eastern Roman continuity; critical for “East–West” division)

Key dynastic arcs (selected):

* **Justinianic** (6th c.) → **Heraclian** (7th–8th c.) → **Isaurian** (8th c.)
* **Macedonian** (9th–11th c.; major revival)
* **Komnenian** (11th–12th c.) → fragmentation after 1204 → **Palaiologan** restoration (1261–1453) → fall to Ottomans

##### H) Ottoman Europe / Balkans (an essential European dynastic empire)

* **Ottoman dynasty** (c. 1299–1922): Balkan conquest from 14th c.; Constantinople 1453; long SE European imperial order; collapse after WWI

##### I) Scandinavia (stable constitutional monarchies; long dynastic continuity)

* **Denmark**: **Oldenburg** (1448–1863) → **Glücksburg** (1863–present)
* **Sweden**: **Vasa** (1523–1654) → Palatinate-Zweibrücken (17th–18th c.) → Holstein-Gottorp (18th–19th c.) → **Bernadotte** (1818–present)
* **Norway**: union phases (Denmark, then Sweden) → modern constitutional monarchy (20th c.)

##### J) Poland–Lithuania (dynastic monarchy → elective system → partitions)

* **Piast** (10th–14th c.) → **Jagiellon** (1386–1572)
* Elective monarchy era (multiple houses; including **Vasa** 1587–1668; Wettin/Saxon kings 1697–1763)
* Partitions (1772/1793/1795) eliminate the state until modern restorations

#### III) A “precise” way to divide Europe that integrates dynasties

If you want a *usable analytic division* (not just dates), use three nested layers:

1. **Civilizational blocs (c. 700–1700):**

   * **Latin Christendom** (papacy + western monarchies: Capetians, Plantagenets, Habsburgs, etc.)
   * **Greek Orthodox East** (Byzantium → Orthodox successor states; later Russian imperial claim)
   * **Islamic Mediterranean/SE Europe** (al-Andalus; Ottoman Balkans)

2. **State-system regimes (c. 1500–present):**

   * Composite dynastic empires (Habsburg, Ottoman, Romanov)
   * Balance-of-power multi-state system (post-1648)
   * Nation-state order (19th–20th c.)
   * Ideological bloc order (Cold War)
   * Integration + security competition (post-1991)

3. **Dynastic legitimacy (to 1918; residual thereafter):**

   * Dynastic succession chains that determine inheritance, war claims, diplomacy, and imperial formation.
