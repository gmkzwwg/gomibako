## 什么是哲学？

1. **伯特兰·罗素**：“研究哲学不是为了对哲学问题做出明确的回答……而是为了**问题本身**；因为这些问题**扩展了我们对可能之物的构想**，丰富了我们理智的想象力，**减少了使心灵封闭起来不作思索的自以为是**；但主要是因为，通过对伟大的宇宙进行哲学沉思，心灵也变得伟大起来。”
2. 哲学是一种对大部分时间里被认为理所当然、从未有过疑问，或者从未明确表达出来的想法，**提出根本性质问**的过程。
3. 哲学教给我们怎样去**思考、澄清和论证**我们所相信的东西；我们**亲自厘清**这些想法，然后用一种令人信服的方式**呈现**给其他可能持不同意见的人。
4. 人类在探求哲学的过程中，分类出来了很多学科，它们形成了自己的研究方法和生命周期；但仍有剩下不能归类的东西，就是哲学。
> 亚里士多德：所有学科……都有其服务的对象，但惟独哲学是为了自身而被追求的学问……哲学是自由人的学问。

## 什么是哲学？
* Philosophy isn't just a subject, it is an activity we have to engage in, something that we have to do. 哲学不仅仅是一个学科，它是我们每一个都必须参与的活动。
* Philosophy is the activity of working out the best way to think about things. 哲学是以最佳方式思考事物的活动。

哲学与其他学科的联系
* What the philosopher needs to say in response to it is to distinguish between the activity of getting on with thinking a particular way and the activity of stepping back from that way of thinking, and working out the right way. 其他学科的使你以一种特定方式思考问题。哲学使你从这种特定思维中后退一步，并找出思考此学科的正确方式。
* There are a couple of different ways that we can be prompted to revise our way of thinking about things. 我们可以使用一些方法重新审视我们思考问题的方法。
* One sort of way can be making that revision from the insight. 一类方法是洞察。比如在物理学实验中，究竟是什么原理，使得数据可以证明或者证否理论。 
* Another way that we might be prompted to change the way that we are thinking about things is from the outside. 另外一类方法是从外部思考。以20世纪量子力学的创设为例：物理学家使观察世界，做了一系列实验并观察结果。很多我们对于世界的基本认识被彻底改变了。

哲学式提问
* Philosophical question can arise almost anywhere. We can always step back and ask for a justification or articulation of the particular assumptions or presuppositions that we're employing when we're thinking about something in some way. 哲学问题在几乎所有地方都可能产生。当我们以某种方式思考某些问题时，我们总是能退一步，厘清采用的假设和先决条件的合理性和表达方式。
*  What the philosopher is doing to what a child is doing when they're continuously asking why. 哲学家所做的事情，就像小孩子一样，连续地提出一系列关于“为什么”的问题。
* It's fair to say that just in virtue of a question's being philosophical that doesn't necessarily make it an important one. But I do think that philosophical questions and philosophical questioning often is very important. 可以这样说，仅仅凭借一个问题的哲学性，并不一定能使它成为一个重要的问题。但我认为，一般来说，哲学问题和哲学式提问往往非常重要。
* Looking at the bad ways of thinking and behaving that people have used in the past can show us why stepping back and reflecting on those ways can be a really, really important thing to do. 回顾历史上人类使用过的糟糕思考方式和行为，可以使我们知道为什么退一步思考，反思这些方式至关重要。


# What Is Philosophy? A Historical and Metaphilosophical Inquiry

## Introduction

What **is** philosophy? This seemingly simple question has elicited radically different answers across the history of Western thought. From antiquity to today, philosophers have offered diverse conceptions of their own enterprise. Is philosophy the **love of wisdom** (as its Greek name suggests), a **scientific search for ultimate truth**, a **critical method** of inquiry, a **creative art**, or even a kind of **therapy** for the mind? This article provides a scholarly critical review of how major Western philosophers—from Plato and Aristotle through Descartes, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Russell, Wittgenstein, Heidegger, Quine, and beyond—have understood the nature and purpose of philosophy. We will examine key reflections and aphorisms (in English translation) in which these thinkers define or exemplify what philosophy means to them. In doing so, we engage in **metaphilosophy**: the philosophy of philosophy itself, reflecting on the aims, methods, and identity of the discipline. By surveying the full historical range of Western philosophy, we will see that conceptions of philosophy have been plural and often in tension. Finally, we consider whether philosophy has any definable essence or whether it is best seen as a family of evolving, heterogeneous practices.

## Ancient Greek Conceptions: Philosophy as the Love of Wisdom

Western philosophy began in ancient Greece, where the very word _philosophia_ meant “love of wisdom.” In Plato’s dialogues, Socrates and his interlocutors often characterize philosophy as the pursuit of wisdom and truth about the most important questions. Plato has Socrates suggest that **“wonder is the feeling of a philosopher, and philosophy begins in wonder.”** In the _Theaetetus_, Socrates connects philosophy to the human capacity for puzzlement at things we do not yet understand, remarking that this sense of wonder (thauma) is the starting point of philosophizing. Philosophy, in this view, begins with a sense of awe and inquiry into the mysteries of reality. Likewise, Socrates famously claimed in Plato’s _Apology_ that **“the unexamined life is not worth living”** (Apology 38a). He saw it as his mission to question people’s unwarranted convictions, helping them recognize their ignorance and turn toward the pursuit of wisdom. The Socratic perspective thus defines philosophy as **critical self-examination** and care for the soul, an activity so important that living without it would deprive life of its highest value.

Aristotle, a student of Plato, continued the exaltation of theoretical wisdom while giving it a more systematic definition. According to Aristotle, **“philosophy begins in wonder”** just as Plato said, and it **“seeks the most fundamental causes or principles of things”**. In his _Metaphysics_, Aristotle observes that it was wonder (puzzlement at the world) that first led people to philosophize, and that philosophers aim to escape ignorance by understanding the first principles of nature. He calls this highest knowledge “first philosophy” – what later came to be known as metaphysics – the inquiry into being _as such_ and the ultimate reasons why things are. Aristotle also famously remarks that such knowledge is pursued **“for its own sake”** and is “the most divine” science, precisely because it is least immediately useful for practical needs. This captures a classical view: philosophy is valued not for any material gain but for attaining wisdom about the deepest truths. At the same time, Aristotle did not ignore practical philosophy; he wrote works on ethics and politics, viewing ethical wisdom as a kind of “political science” aimed at the good life. Still, for the Greeks, the paradigm of philosophy was theoretical wisdom. The **“love of wisdom” (philo-sophia)** encompassed both understanding the cosmos and living virtuously, with an emphasis on rational inquiry into nature and the human condition.

**Hellenistic philosophers** (Stoics, Epicureans, Skeptics) later shifted emphasis to philosophy as a _way of life_ and spiritual **therapy**. For example, the Stoics and Epicureans held that philosophy’s role was to identify what is truly valuable and to cure human beings of irrational fears and desires, much like medicine for the soul. An Epicurean maxim states: _“Empty is the word of that philosopher which does not heal any suffering of man”_, declaring philosophy useless if it does not ease human distress. In a similar vein, the Roman thinker Cicero claimed _“to study philosophy is to prepare oneself for death,”_ stressing its role in coping with mortality. Thus, even in antiquity, we see different ontological models of philosophy: Plato and Aristotle portray it as a quest for timeless knowledge, whereas others stress its therapeutic and practical function for living well. The tension between **philosophy as theoretical truth-seeking** and **philosophy as a practical guide to life** was present from the start.

## Philosophy in the Early Modern Era: Method and Foundations

The rise of modern science in the 17th century transformed conceptions of philosophy. **René Descartes** (1596–1650), often called the father of modern philosophy, famously compared the whole of knowledge to a tree, with metaphysics as its roots, physics as the trunk, and the other sciences as branches. For Descartes, philosophy was the **foundation of all human knowledge**. In a preface to his _Principles of Philosophy_, he offered a broad definition: **“the word ‘philosophy’ means the study (or love) of wisdom, and by ‘wisdom’ is meant not only prudence in everyday affairs but also a perfect knowledge of all things that mankind is capable of knowing”**. This reflects the Cartesian ambition to achieve a systematic and **unified science**, starting from indubitable first principles. Descartes believed the method of doubt and rational reflection could secure certain foundations (such as the _cogito_ ergo sum) upon which all sciences could be built. Philosophy, in this rationalist vision, was very much a **scientia** – a body of knowledge – encompassing both theoretical understanding and practical knowledge (medicine, mechanics, morals) under one rational framework.

British empiricists of the 17th–18th centuries also viewed philosophy as the project of building reliable knowledge, though they emphasized observational experience. John Locke, for instance, described his own role as that of an “under-laborer” clearing the ground for the sciences by examining the limits of human understanding. In Locke’s _Essay Concerning Human Understanding_, he aligns philosophy with the **love of truth** and says the sure sign of this love is **“entertaining no proposition with greater assurance than the proofs it is built upon will warrant.”** This methodological humility exemplifies the empiricist conception of philosophy as _critical inquiry_: the philosopher’s task is to investigate the origin and validity of knowledge, distinguishing justified belief from mere speculation. David Hume takes this critical stance even further. In the introduction to his _Treatise_, Hume famously aimed to introduce the “experimental method of reasoning into moral subjects,” effectively **naturalizing philosophy**. He also remarked (in a later essay) that **one advantage of philosophy is its “sovereign antidote” against superstition** and unfounded religion. Here the philosopher is cast in the role of **skeptic** and **debunker of prejudices**, using careful reasoning to dispel cultural dogmas – an echo of Socratic critique, but now grounded in empiricist science.

For the early moderns, then, philosophy was closely tied to the emerging **scientific worldview** and methods. Whether through Descartes’ rationalist system-building or Locke and Hume’s empirical critique, philosophy sought a **methodological fresh start** that would yield secure knowledge. It is in this period that the sub-disciplines of philosophy (metaphysics, epistemology, ethics) took shape in something like their modern form, each asking foundational questions: What can we know? What ought we to do? How should we reason? These very questions would be explicitly thematized by Immanuel Kant at the end of the 18th century.

## Enlightenment and German Idealism: Philosophy as Critique and System

**Immanuel Kant** (1724–1804) dramatically reformulated the nature of philosophy by insisting on its critical, self-reflective role. Living in the Age of Enlightenment, Kant believed the proper task of philosophy was to examine the limits and conditions of reason itself. In his _Critique of Pure Reason_, Kant enumerates the **three fundamental questions of philosophy**: **“What can I know? What ought I to do? What may I hope?”**, all ultimately grounded in a fourth, “What is man?”. Answering these, for Kant, required a critique of reason’s capabilities in science, morality, and religion. He famously described his work as a “Copernican revolution” in philosophy: instead of the mind conforming to objects, objects conform to the structure of our mind. Thus the task of philosophy is not to establish metaphysical truths _out there_ by sheer reason (as rationalists tried), but to **delimit the boundaries** within which knowledge and belief are possible. Kant defined philosophy as a kind of metadiscipline: **“Philosophy’s peculiar dignity lies in establishing the principles of morality, legislation, and religion”** accessible to human reason. In other words, philosophy should arrive at principles that guide action and faith, but only after investigating what reason _can and cannot_ do. This **critical philosophy** set limits to metaphysics (we cannot know things-in-themselves) while defending the rational basis of ethics and hope. Kant’s approach illustrates philosophy as **reflexive critique** – a second-order discipline that inquires into the conditions of possibility of first-order knowledge and norms. It is **neither a mere science of facts nor a mere art of speculation, but a tribunal of reason** assessing itself.

Kant’s profound rethinking of philosophy paved the way for **German Idealism**, which reimagined philosophy on an even grander systematic scale. **G.W.F. Hegel** (1770–1831) in particular conceived of philosophy as the culmination of the spirit’s quest to understand itself and reality. In the preface to his _Philosophy of Right_, Hegel famously stated: **“Philosophy is its own time comprehended in thoughts.”** By this he meant that each philosophical system is an intellectual expression of its historical epoch, and that his own philosophy aimed to _grasp the present and its rationality_ through concepts. For Hegel, philosophy was the **“science of the Absolute”**, an all-encompassing systematic knowledge in which truth unfolds through a dialectical process. He held that genuine philosophy recognizes the rational development in history and thereby reconciles the thinking mind with the world. As one commentator summarizes Hegel’s goal: philosophy enables us **“to recognize the embodiment of our ideals in our social and political lives and thereby to be at home in the world.”** In Hegel’s view, then, philosophy has a fundamentally **reconciliatory and holistic** role: it reveals the logical necessity behind reality, showing that “the real is rational.” Even Hegel’s metaphilosophical imagery underlines the reflective nature of philosophy: _“the Owl of Minerva takes flight only at dusk,”_ meaning philosophy understands events only after the fact, in hindsight. This is a very different stance from the forward-looking, prescriptive ambitions of earlier thinkers like Descartes. For Hegel, philosophy is **retrospective comprehension** – the highest form of thought, which comes at the end of a historical process to articulate the truth that has actualized itself.

The **German Idealist** and Romantic era thus saw philosophy as either a _critical arbiter_ (in Kant’s case) or a _totalizing system_ that brings complete understanding (in Hegel’s case). Notably, both Kant and Hegel insisted that philosophy is **rigorous and systematic**, more akin to a science (_Wissenschaft_) than to art or poetry. Yet they also saw it as fundamentally different from the natural sciences: philosophy for them deals with freedom, morality, spirit, and meaning – domains that cannot be simply handed off to empirical science. This period also raised explicitly the question of philosophy’s **own nature**. Hegel wrote a _History of Philosophy_ to show a rational progression in how philosophy understood itself, and Kant in his lectures asked what philosophy _can_ achieve. In short, Enlightenment and Idealist thinkers made metaphilosophy part of philosophy: the **self-conscious reflection on the philosophical enterprise** became central. The stage was set for later thinkers who would challenge whether such grand systems or critical projects were even possible.

## Reactions in the 19th Century: Philosophy as Art, Critique, or Praxis

By the late 19th century, a backlash against grand systematic philosophy emerged. Figures like **Friedrich Nietzsche** (1844–1900) radically challenged traditional assumptions about what philosophy is and ought to be. Nietzsche was skeptical that philosophy is a search for objective or eternal truth; he saw past philosophies largely as expressions of their authors’ personal moral prejudices and psychological needs. In _Beyond Good and Evil_, Nietzsche provocatively suggests that **“behind all logic and its seeming sovereignty of movement, there are valuations… physiological demands for the maintenance of a certain mode of life”**. In other words, every philosophy is ultimately a confession of its originator’s instincts and biases. This marks a turn from seeing philosophy as pure rational inquiry to seeing it as **deeply rooted in life, culture, and the philosopher’s perspective**. Nietzsche’s own conception of the philosopher was anything but a detached academic or system-builder. _“How I understand the philosopher,”_ he wrote in _Ecce Homo_, is as **“a terrible explosive, endangering everything… my concept of the philosopher is worlds removed from any concept that would include even a Kant, not to speak of the academic ‘ruminants’”**. This colorful description shows Nietzsche’s view of genuine philosophers as **rebels and creators** – free spirits who break up prevailing idols and value-systems. He ridiculed the scholars who merely chew over old ideas (“ruminants”), implying that true philosophy is an existential, innovative, even dangerous enterprise.

For Nietzsche, then, philosophy became a form of **cultural critique and creation of values**. He famously announced that all values hitherto were based on a “Platonism for the masses” (i.e. Christianity), and he called for “philosophers of the future” who would create new values _beyond good and evil_. In this sense, he shifted the focus from discovering truth to **inventing new ways of thinking and living**. Some have called Nietzsche’s approach a kind of **“philosophy as art”**, given his aphoristic, literary style and emphasis on creativity. Indeed, Nietzsche often philosophized through aphorisms, parables, and attacks on the pretensions of metaphysics, more in the mode of an artist-poet than a systematic theorist. His work exemplifies a conception of philosophy as **self-expression and cultural experimentation** – the _philosopher_ as one who _revaluates_ all values. This was a stark contrast to the academic, systematic philosophy of his time.

Another challenge to traditional conceptions came from the socio-political sphere. **Karl Marx** (1818–1883), although not listed in our main roster, famously criticized previous philosophy for interpreting the world when the point is to change it. Marx’s _Thesis Eleven_ stated: **“Philosophers have hitherto only interpreted the world in various ways; the point is to change it.”**. This marks philosophy as **praxis** – a tool for social transformation. From a Marxian perspective, philosophy should not cloister itself in abstract questions but actively participate in confronting material and political conditions. The influence of this idea in the 19th and 20th centuries (e.g. in critical theory and pragmatism) further diversified what counts as philosophy. It suggested that in addition to science or art, philosophy could be seen as a form of **social criticism** or revolutionary theory.

By 1900, the stage was set with multiple, often clashing roles for the philosopher: _scientist_, _critic_, _poet_, _revolutionary_. The **identity of philosophy** had become problematic and fertile ground for debate. This ferment leads directly into the 20th century, where we find an explicit concern with _metaphilosophy_—philosophy’s own nature, method, and purpose—being addressed by philosophers themselves.

## Twentieth Century Analytic Approaches: Philosophy as Logical Analysis or Language Therapy

In the early 20th century, one influential movement was **Analytic philosophy**, led by figures like Bertrand Russell and Ludwig Wittgenstein. They reacted against the speculative excesses of idealism and sought to put philosophy on a clear logical footing. **Bertrand Russell** (1872–1970) exemplified the analytic view that philosophy’s primary task is **clarifying concepts and propositions**. He and G.E. Moore argued that many philosophical problems arise from imprecise use of language or confusion of logic, so the remedy is careful analysis. In his classic essay "The Value of Philosophy," however, Russell also reflected on why philosophy matters at all, given it yields no definite answers like the sciences do. Russell eloquently wrote: **“Philosophy is to be studied, not for the sake of any definite answers to its questions, since no definite answers can, as a rule, be known to be true, but rather for the sake of the questions themselves.”** Philosophy’s value, he argued, lies in its ability to **enlarge our understanding of what is possible, enrich our imagination, and free us from the “tyranny of custom.”** It keeps alive our sense of wonder by showing familiar things in an unfamiliar light. In short, Russell saw philosophy as **primarily an _open-ended inquiry_** – its very uncertainty is beneficial because it opens the mind and combats dogmatism. This reflective passage reveals Russell’s conception of philosophy as _continuous questioning_. Despite being an advocate of scientific rigor, he did not reduce philosophy to science; rather, he valued it for addressing those great questions (about the universe, consciousness, ethics) which science has not answered and perhaps cannot decisively answer. Russell thus straddles two views: philosophy as **analytic clarification** (a method) and philosophy as **a worldview-expanding pursuit** (an exploration of possibilities and values).

Russell’s younger contemporary, **Ludwig Wittgenstein** (1889–1951), took the analytic focus on language to new depths and ultimately transformed his own view of philosophy’s task. Early in his _Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus_ (1921), Wittgenstein declared: **“The object of philosophy is the logical clarification of thoughts. Philosophy is not a theory but an activity.”** (Tractatus §4.112). In this early view, heavily influenced by Russell, philosophy should do nothing except analyze propositions, _showing_ the logical structure that underpins meaningful language and separating sense from nonsense. Any attempt to _say_ metaphysical truths was, in Wittgenstein’s early opinion, a confusion – at the end of the _Tractatus_ he famously concludes, _“Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.”_ Thus, early analytic philosophy cast itself as a **second-order discipline**: not expanding the content of human knowledge, but **policing the language** of science and everyday discourse to prevent meaningless utterances.

However, Wittgenstein’s later philosophy (as seen in _Philosophical Investigations_, published 1953) took a different turn, introducing a therapeutic conception of philosophy. He came to believe that philosophical problems are not solved by logical theory but by careful attention to how language actually functions in practice. One of his celebrated later aphorisms is: **“Philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language.”**. On this view, philosophical confusions (for example, puzzles about the mind, or free will, or universals) arise because we are **“bewitched” by language** – misled by taking words out of their ordinary context and then getting entangled in pseudo-problems. Therefore, the philosopher’s job is akin to therapy: to untangle these knots by examining how words are used, thereby dissolving the illusory problems. Wittgenstein even likened the philosopher to a doctor: **“The philosopher’s treatment of a question is like the treatment of an illness”**, he wrote, suggesting that philosophical puzzlement is a kind of sickness that needs a cure through clear use of language. This **therapeutic conception** starkly contrasts with the idea of philosophy as discovery of cosmic truths. For the later Wittgenstein (and the Ordinary Language philosophers he inspired), philosophy was **neither science nor metaphysical art**, but an _activity of clarification_ aimed at achieving intellectual peace: _“to show the fly the way out of the fly-bottle,”_ as he put it metaphorically.

The analytic tradition thus yielded multiple metaphilosophical stances. Some (like early Wittgenstein and the Logical Positivists) saw philosophy as **logic and science’s handmaiden**, clarifying statements and rejecting metaphysics. Others (like later Wittgenstein, the Ordinary Language school, and many in ethics) saw it as a **pragmatic exercise** in understanding and possibly improving how we think and speak about life’s problems. By mid-20th century, a number of analytic philosophers even suggested that **philosophy is continuous with science** – it just deals with more general or abstract questions. For instance, W.V. **Quine** (1908–2000) advanced a robust form of naturalism, arguing that there is no fundamental difference in kind between scientific inquiry and philosophical inquiry. He famously claimed that **“ontological questions… are on a par with questions of natural science”**, and that **“it is only within science itself, and not in some prior philosophy, that reality is to be identified and described.”**. In Quine’s naturalized epistemology, traditional philosophical attempts to found science on pure reason or observation were misguided; instead, philosophy should _take science as given_ and work within it to clarify and extend it. Quine thus treated philosophy as an **extension or abstraction of the best scientific knowledge**, with no separate “first philosophy” standing above or before science. The role left for philosophers, in Quine’s view, was modest: to help translate science into a logically coherent form (he spoke of philosophers aiding in “regimenting” scientific theories into formal logic) and to streamline our conceptual scheme. This is a **deflationary view** of philosophy’s ontological status: philosophy becomes part of the scientific enterprise, not a queen of the sciences as some medieval thinkers imagined, nor a foundation under the sciences as Descartes sought, but simply **continuous with science’s most general theoretical efforts**.

In summary, 20th-century analytic philosophy oscillated between seeing philosophy as a _highly specialized logical therapy_ and seeing it as _continuous with empirical science_. What unites these approaches is a rejection of grand speculative system-building and an emphasis on clarity and rigor. Yet even within analytic philosophy, debates raged (and continue to rage) about whether philosophy discovers substantive truths or merely resolves confusions, whether it should have a **technical scientific character** or speak to **general human concerns**, and whether it is **autonomous** or **subordinate to science**. These debates are themselves part of metaphilosophy – evidence of the field’s plural and evolving self-conception.

## Twentieth Century Continental Approaches: Philosophy as Existence, Meaning, and Critique

Parallel to analytic philosophy, the 20th century also witnessed rich developments in the Continental tradition (broadly, European philosophy outside the analytic Anglophone focus). Here, too, conceptions of philosophy varied—from Edmund Husserl’s vision of rigorous science to existentialists’ idea of philosophy as a personal quest, and postmodern critiques of the philosophical tradition.

**Edmund Husserl** (1859–1938), the founder of phenomenology, in some ways echoed the old ideal of philosophy as a strict science. He decried the fragmenting of knowledge and sought to restore philosophy as the **“science of all sciences”**, providing ultimate foundations. Husserl defined phenomenology as the study of structures of consciousness, aiming for insights into essences that would be **apodictic** (indubitable). He wrote of returning “to the things themselves” and insisted that philosophy could be **rigorous and foundational** if it adhered to describing experience without unwarranted speculation. Yet Husserl also emphasized that philosophy is a deeply **personal and humane enterprise**: it was, for him, vital to the _“hopes of the Enlightenment”_, a means toward a more rational and just society. This combination of scientific aspiration and humanistic spirit shows philosophy straddling the line between objective discipline and guiding worldview.

Husserl’s phenomenology gave rise to **Existentialist** and **Hermeneutic** thinkers (Heidegger, Sartre, Gadamer, etc.) who reconceived philosophy in more historical and practical terms. **Martin Heidegger** (1889–1976), originally a student of Husserl, turned phenomenology toward the question of **Being** and radically critiqued the entire Western philosophical tradition as “metaphysics of presence” that had forgotten the true question of Being. Heidegger argued that since Plato, philosophers had become too enamored of abstract reason and had lost sight of the wonder of Being itself. In his view, philosophy needed to be transformed into a more **primordial thinking**. Heidegger often avoided the word “philosophy” in his later writings, preferring “thinking” to indicate a new approach beyond traditional metaphysics. He advocated what he called **“post-metaphysical thinking”** – a kind of reflection that would not trap Being in the old concepts. For example, in his _Letter on Humanism_ (1947), Heidegger famously said that **“Language is the house of Being”** and that thinking should be in service of letting Being speak, rather than forcing it into conceptual grids. This poetic, elusive approach casts philosophy as **meditative insight** rather than logical analysis or scientific theorizing. Heidegger went so far as to declare that _philosophy, as traditionally understood, had come to an end_, precisely because it was rooted in metaphysical thinking tied to an image of man (as rational animal, etc.) that needed overcoming. In place of philosophy, he envisioned a **“non-impositional” thinking** that is more listening than explaining.

Despite Heidegger’s own reluctance to define philosophy in simple terms, one can say he returned to an ancient idea: that philosophy (or thinking) begins in **wonder and awe** at the mystery of Being. Yet unlike Aristotle’s confident pursuit of first principles, Heidegger’s wonder has a humbled, almost mystical character – a sense of gratitude and releasement toward Being. In practical terms, Heidegger also believed that philosophical thinking could help diagnose the ills of modern technological society (which he traced to metaphysical nihilism). Thus, he saw his “post-metaphysical” philosophy as having an **emancipatory potential** not unlike critical theory (albeit in a very different register).

Continental philosophy after Heidegger splintered into numerous schools, but many were _metaphilosophical_ in that they questioned the methods and goals of philosophy itself. For example, **Critical Theory** (the Frankfurt School: Horkheimer, Adorno, later Habermas) saw philosophy as a critical tool to **unmask ideology and advance human emancipation**. Max Horkheimer described critical theory’s aim as not just interpreting society (echoing Marx) but transforming it by exposing power and domination. Habermas, a second-generation Frankfurt thinker, argued for a _“postmetaphysical thinking”_ that would relinquish grand ontologies but still defend reason in the public sphere. He maintained that philosophy should become a partner to the social sciences and critical public discourse, rather than an aloof absolutist enterprise.

Another Continental current, **Post-structuralism and Deconstruction**, explicitly thematized the end of philosophy in the traditional sense. **Jacques Derrida** (1930–2004) famously deconstructed the texts of the Western canon, showing how they undermine their own philosophical claims. Derrida’s approach treats philosophy as one **literary genre** among others – its distinction from literature, politics, or rhetoric is blurred. He suggested that philosophy’s search for ultimate meaning or presence is inevitably frustrated by the play of language (the _différance_). As a result, he and others advanced a conception of philosophy as **textual critique**: an unending task of analyzing and unsettling conceptual binaries (like speech/writing, presence/absence) that earlier philosophers took for granted. In one sense, this is **anti-philosophy as traditionally understood**, since it casts doubt on the possibility of any stable definition or method for philosophy. Yet in another sense it broadens philosophy into a form of **cultural and ethical practice**: by deconstructing concepts, one can, for instance, challenge ethnocentrism, phallogocentrism, and other hidden biases in philosophical and everyday language. Derrida saw his work as having an ethical-political import: loosening the grip of inherited metaphysical assumptions could be liberating.

Finally, contemporary Continental voices like **Gilles Deleuze** (1925–1995) have offered novel positive definitions of philosophy. In their book _What Is Philosophy?_ (1991), Deleuze and Félix Guattari answer the title question succinctly: **“Philosophy is the art of forming, inventing, and fabricating concepts… more rigorously, philosophy is the discipline that involves creating concepts.”**. This definition explicitly sets philosophy apart from science and art: where science deals in functions and laws, and art in percepts and affects, _philosophy’s unique role is the creation of new concepts_. Deleuze and Guattari thus revive a creative view of philosophy (somewhat akin to Nietzsche’s), but without Nietzsche’s focus on the philosopher’s individual will to power. Instead, they emphasize that every era has its concepts, and philosophers are those who **“think the new”** by generating concepts that respond to their time. Their conception positions philosophy as **conceptual innovation**, a kind of **creative art**, albeit with rigor: a concept is not invented arbitrarily but in response to a real problem or “plane of immanence.” This stands in contrast to seeing philosophy as discovering eternal truths; for Deleuze, no concept is eternal, but it can be well-formed or badly formed, and its value lies in what future thought it enables. Notably, Deleuze and Guattari also distance their view from pure relativism—concept creation is constrained by the problems and empirical realities concepts address. Nonetheless, their answer encapsulates a contemporary ethos that **philosophy has no one fixed subject matter or method; it is characterized by an inventive spirit**. In an age where the sciences have their own domains, philosophy for them becomes the space of **conceptual experimentation** where new ways of thinking take shape.

As we see, 20th-century Continental philosophies expanded the profile of philosophy into **existential, hermeneutic, critical, and creative** modes that sometimes diverged sharply from the analytic modes. Yet across both traditions, a self-awareness of philosophy’s plurality grew. It became common to acknowledge that what counts as doing philosophy in one tradition (e.g. logical analysis) might look utterly foreign in another (e.g. deconstructive reading or phenomenological description). This raises the question: faced with this diversity, is there anything _common_ to all these activities called “philosophy”? Or is philosophy essentially **pluralistic**, lacking a single identity?

## Philosophy as Science, Art, or Therapy? The Ontological Status of Philosophy

Throughout the historical views surveyed, we can identify several recurring ideas about **what type of endeavor philosophy is**. Philosophers have variously likened their discipline to a science, an art, a form of therapy, a kind of analysis, or a guide to life. Here we summarize some of these conceptions and their proponents:

*   **Philosophy as Science or Knowledge:** Many philosophers have seen philosophy as a _science_ (in the broad pre-modern sense of systematic knowledge). Aristotle called it the most divine science, seeking ultimate causes. Descartes envisioned philosophy as a unified field of knowledge, the root of all sciences. Kant considered metaphysics a possible science of the a priori conditions of experience (though he also critiqued its pretensions). Hegel outright termed his system a “science of logic” and thought philosophy reaches **truth** in a scientific manner (dialectically). Husserl too insisted on philosophy as _rigorous science_. In these views, philosophy aims at **objective knowledge** – whether about being, reason, or structures of experience. It is expected to use rational methods (logic, dialectic, phenomenological insight) to arrive at truths that, while not empirical, have a claim to universality or necessity. Even Quine’s naturalism, which folded philosophy into science, treated philosophy as continuous with the scientific effort to describe reality truly.
    
*   **Philosophy as Critical Method or Analysis:** Another view emphasizes _how_ philosophy proceeds rather than any particular content. Here philosophy is essentially a **method of questioning and clarification**. The Socratic **dialectic** is an early example: philosophy as careful questioning and definition of terms (like justice or virtue). In modern times, this reappears in the **analytic tradition** – philosophy as logical analysis of language and concepts (Frege, Russell, early Wittgenstein). Philosophers in this mold often see their work as **second-order**: they do not expand factual knowledge but clarify the concepts and arguments of other fields. This approach tends to self-identify as **methodologically rigorous**, putting a premium on clarity and logical coherence. It sometimes carries an austere view of philosophy’s scope: as Wittgenstein said, _“Philosophy is not a body of doctrine but an activity”_ – namely, the activity of clarifying propositions. The **methodic** conception can also include Kant’s critical method (philosophy as critique of reason’s method) and even aspects of phenomenology (with its structured method of epoché and eidetic reduction). In all cases, philosophy is seen less as a content-domain (like physics or history) and more as a **disciplinary approach** or toolset that can be applied to any subject matter. The payoff of this approach is often described in terms of **intellectual hygiene** – it prevents confusion and improves thinking, rather than yielding new facts.
    
*   **Philosophy as Worldview or Vision:** Especially in 19th-century and Romantic thought, philosophy was often tied to **worldview construction**. German Idealists (Fichte, Schelling, Hegel) and later system-builders saw philosophy as providing a _big picture_ that synthesizes human knowledge and aspirations. A philosophy in this sense is akin to an intellectual world-picture addressing science, art, religion, and politics in one framework. For example, Hegel’s system attempts to incorporate history, nature, art, religion, and state into a single developmental logic. Similarly, in the late 19th century, **Wilhelm Dilthey** spoke of philosophy as an expression of the philosopher’s life-experience and an attempt to articulate a _Weltanschauung_ (worldview). This approach gives philosophy a **cultural and integrative role** – less concerned with minute analysis, more with broad synthesis. It often treats philosophy and literature or philosophy and history as contiguous (e.g. Nietzsche and later existentialists write in literary styles, blending philosophical insight with cultural critique). In the 20th century, **existentialists** like Sartre or Camus (though not academic philosophers in the narrow sense) continued using philosophy to paint an overall vision of the human condition (absurd, free, burdened by choice, etc.). **Richard Rorty** in the late 20th century, from a very different angle, suggested philosophy is best understood as a kind of writing that can spark cultural conversation, rather than a discipline achieving objective results. In all these, philosophy’s ontological status is close to the humanities or arts: it produces **interpretations of life** and overall meaning, competing narratives rather than final proofs.
    
*   **Philosophy as Art of Concept-Creation:** As noted, Deleuze and Guattari explicitly call philosophy an **art** – not of painting or music, but of inventing concepts. This idea resonates with any philosophers who emphasized originality and imagination (Nietzsche’s _philosopher-artist_, Henri Bergson’s creative intuition, William James’s and John Dewey’s pragmatist idea of truth as evolving). On this model, philosophers are more like **artists or poets** than like scientists: their work is judged by its originality, insight, and the power of its concepts to illumine experience, not by experimental confirmation. A concept, like a work of art, can be admired, critiqued, or discarded by later generations – but it is not straightforwardly true or false in isolation. This conception elevates **creativity** as the core of philosophizing. It often goes hand in hand with a rejection of the strict analytic method. For example, Rorty (again) argued that a great philosopher is closer to a great novelist who imagines new vocabularies, rather than a technician solving a puzzle. The risk here is that philosophy could lose any distinct method and blur into literature or “theory” in general – which indeed some celebrate and others lament.
    
*   **Philosophy as Therapy and Self-Transformation:** Another persistent thread defines philosophy by its **practical impact on the soul or society**. We saw this in the Hellenistic era: Stoics and Epicureans treating philosophy as medicine for the soul. In modern times, Wittgenstein’s concept of therapy continues this line in a more intellectual vein – dissolving philosophical anxieties by therapy of thought. The commonality is the idea that philosophy _heals_ or _improves_ the human situation. **Existential psychotherapy** and **philosophical counseling** today even explicitly draw on Stoic and existential ideas to help individuals find meaning or cope with life’s challenges, showing this conception’s durability. Also, Marx’s injunction to change the world suggests a macro-therapy: philosophy as the cure for social ills (via ideology critique and revolutionary praxis). Under this broad umbrella, philosophy’s worth is measured by its **ethical-existential effect**: Does it alleviate suffering? Does it guide one to live better, more wisely or justly? Pierre Hadot, a 20th-century scholar, famously characterized ancient philosophy as _“a way of life”_, and argued that modern philosophy lost this existential dimension as it became academic. There is a contemporary movement in philosophy trying to reclaim this view, making philosophical practice more about personal and moral development, in dialogue with its original meaning as love of wisdom.
    

These categories are not mutually exclusive, and many philosophers fit into several. For example, Plato was a visionary who created enduring concepts (Forms, Philosopher-King), clearly saw philosophy as care for the soul (therapy), but also pursued it as a rational inquiry (proto-science). The **ontological status** of philosophy – whether it is like a science, an art, a craft, or something sui generis – has often been **implicit** rather than explicitly debated. But in the 20th and 21st centuries, it has become an explicit topic in metaphilosophy. Philosophers now routinely acknowledge that someone calling themselves a philosopher might be doing very different activities depending on their school or context. This leads us finally to ask: is there a _single essence_ of philosophy at all?

## Conclusion: Pluralism or Essence – Defining Philosophy Today

Looking over this historical panorama, one is struck by the **plurality of philosophies**. The Western tradition contains rationalist and empiricist, idealist and materialist, systematic and aphoristic, analytic and continental approaches, each with its own view on what philosophy is. Attempts to give a one-size-fits-all definition of philosophy often falter because they inevitably privilege one approach over others. Perhaps Bertrand Russell put it best when he said philosophy occupies a **“No Man’s Land”** between science and theology – not yielding definite scientific knowledge, yet unlike religion it appeals to reason and evidence. In this in-between space, philosophy’s value is partly in **uncertainty and continuous inquiry**. That meta-level insight, paradoxically, might be as close to an essence as we get: philosophy is the practice of **examining the deepest questions in the most critical manner, without final closure**. It is, as Russell noted, more about the _questions_ and expanding the mind than about settling conclusions.

Modern metaphilosophical discussions often conclude that “philosophy” is a **family-resemblance concept** (to use Wittgenstein’s notion). There may be no single trait shared by all what we call philosophy, but a series of overlapping similarities. For instance, **rational argumentation** is common to most philosophies, yet some emphasize narrative or aphorism (Nietzsche, Kierkegaard) which are less strictly argumentative. **Abstractness** or generality is typical (philosophy asks very general questions like “what is being?” or “what is justice?”), but today some philosophy (e.g. applied ethics, experimental philosophy) deals with concrete or empirical specifics. **Reflectivity** – philosophy reflecting on concepts that other fields take for granted – is perhaps a candidate for a core trait. Philosophy often steps back and asks “What do we mean by ...? What are the assumptions behind ...?” Whether it’s Plato asking “What is justice?” or an analytic philosopher asking “What is a person, in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions?”, this _second-order_ inquiry attitude is a recurrent feature. Even that, however, is not universal (ancient philosophers didn’t think of themselves as second-order; they thought they were discovering truth).

Another candidate for a unifying theme is **critical self-awareness**. From Socrates’ self-declared ignorance to Kant’s critiques to postmodern self-critique of reason, philosophy often involves turning reason upon itself. This makes philosophy essentially **metaphilosophical** at times: part of doing philosophy is figuring out what one’s own method and purpose are. In this light, the diversity of metaphilosophies is itself philosophically instructive. The tensions we observed – between knowledge and art, theory and practice, analysis and speculation – might be ineradicable. Rather than resolve them by excluding some as “not really philosophy,” a critical review such as this suggests that philosophy’s identity may indeed be **historically and methodologically plural**. Each era and thinker remakes “philosophy” in line with their fundamental projects and assumptions.

Does this pluralism mean _anything goes_? Not quite. There is still a coherent tradition of **argumentative discourse about fundamental questions** that links these thinkers, even if loosely. Plato and Derrida would disagree massively on method and substance, yet both engage with earlier thinkers and use reason (even if to critique reason itself in Derrida’s case) in pursuing questions about reality, knowledge, language, etc. So, perhaps one minimal definition of philosophy is: **the ongoing discourse in which reason continually examines itself and everything else**. This definition is admittedly abstract, but it captures why philosophy has persisted. Philosophy is not defined by a subject matter (since it can inquire into almost anything), but by a **type of question and approach**: the type that doesn’t accept things at face value and strives for reflective understanding. It is, in a sense, _the pursuit of wisdom about wisdom_, or _thinking about thinking_.

Metaphilosopher Timothy Williamson quipped that to define philosophy is itself already to _do_ philosophy. This reminds us that our question “What is philosophy?” has no simple answer outside of philosophical investigation. We end, appropriately, not with a final answer but with an appreciation of the question’s richness. As each major philosopher we reviewed has shown, _how one defines philosophy_ is deeply entwined with _how one practices it_. The question thus invites every new generation to articulate what philosophy means for them. In doing so, they carry forward the tradition of reflection that began over 2500 years ago with wonder in ancient Greece and continues today in myriad forms. The **essence of philosophy, if any, may lie in this very commitment to reflective inquiry** – a commitment shared even as the content of philosophy radically changes.

In summary, the Western philosophical tradition offers a tapestry of metaphilosophical viewpoints: philosophy as the **love of wisdom**, as **science of being**, as **critique of reason**, as **dialectical system**, as **existential meaning-making**, as **logical analysis**, as **language therapy**, as **conceptual art**, as **social criticism**, and more. Rather than choose one, a rigorous understanding acknowledges the **legitimacy and limits of each**. The diversity is a sign of philosophy’s vitality: it continually re-invents itself to meet new intellectual and cultural challenges. Perhaps the safest conclusion is that **philosophy has no one definition carved in stone** – instead, it is an evolving conversation about the most basic questions, and about its own nature. In the end, the question "What is philosophy?" _is itself a philosophical question_, one that keeps philosophy perpetually on its toes, challenging it to justify and clarify its existence. And that, arguably, is a good thing for the health of this most reflective of human endeavors. As the 20th-century philosopher Karl Jaspers wrote, _“Philosophy is a way of life in which one keeps oneself in a state of wonder.”_ In that spirit of wonder and critical reflection, philosophy remains, in all its plurality, an essential and uniquely **self-conscious mode of inquiry** into our world and ourselves.

## 我们如何思考？

* premise 前提 
* soundness 合理性 
* argument 论证
* conclusion 结论
* We can question the soundness of an argument either by questioning the truth of its premises or by questioning its validity. 我们判断论证是否合理时，既可以通过提问其前提是否是事实，或者判断这个论证本身是否有效。

* Looking at arguments, identifying their premises, trying to work out whether they're valid, and this is a really crucial part of what it is to do philosophy. 仔细审查论证，验证前提，试着验证他们是否有效，这是做哲学的至关重要的思维。但在哲学中，我们经常绞尽脑汁也无法将我们的思考直接分为一系列的前提和结论。

* Hilary Putnam: hilosophy needs vision and argument. There's something disappointing about a philosophical work that contains arguments, however good, which are not inspired by some genuine vision. And something disappointing about a philosophical work that contains a vision, however inspiring, which is unsupported by arguments. Speculation about how things hang together requires the ability to draw out conceptual distinctions and connections, and the ability to argue. But speculative views, however interesting or well supported by arguments or insightful, are not all we need. We also need what the philosopher Myles Burnyeat called vision and I take that to mean vision as to how to live our lives, and how to order our societies. 希拉里•普特南:哲学需要洞察力和论证……有些哲学著作的论证虽好，洞察力却差，令人失望。而有些哲学著作具有启迪性，却没有好的论证来支撑，同样令人失望……两者结合……则需要找出概念上的差别和关联和证明的能力……然而推测的观点，即使有趣，又有众多证据支持，论证又通达，我们需要的却不止如此，我们还需要哲学家（Myles Burnyeat 所说的）洞察力。我的理解是洞察我们如何生活、如何组织社会。

* When we're engaging with a philosophical argument, we need to do more than just try and identify and assess the premises that it's using, and see if it's a valid argument. I think we also need to think about the vision, the big picture that inspires that argument. 当我们在哲学论证时，要做的不仅仅是验证前提，判断论证是否合法。关注哲学论证是在何种大环境下产生的也非常重要。

### 是否存在对事物正确的思维方式？

我们很容易观察到一个台球滚向另一个台球，导致第二个台球滚动起来导致第二个台球滚动起来。但休谟认为：我们真正的体验到的是，对于两个台球在不同的时间和不同的地点的一系列的印象。但我们从来没有看到任何其他的将这两个台球联系起来的，我们可以称之为因果关系的东西。

在其他各种不同的事物上，休谟也有类似的论调。例如：他认为，我们没有理由认为有一个“自我”将我们所有不同的经验、想法和信念联系起来。因为我们所真实体验到的，就是这些想法、经验和信念。

最有名的也最有争议的是，休谟认为我们无权根据我们的经验去相信一个无所不能、无所不知的上帝。这就是为什么他被安葬在这里后，人们不得不在外面布置士兵守卫，长达数天来守护他的墓。

因此，就休谟的理论来说，通过哲学，我们可以了解到所有我们在联系印象、想法和思想时的习惯，并了解到当我们基于印象得出关于这个世界的结论时的不同倾向。我们永远无法真正知道这些联想时的习惯是否是正确的，哪些是正确的，那些我们得出的结论是否真的使我们更加贴近真实的世界。所以这使休谟到得出结论：哲学都是对人类的盲目和弱点的观察。结果，尽管我们努力逃避或避免，但这些盲目和弱点无处不在。

现在我们知道，休谟对“哲学有能力使我们更加贴近真实的世界”这一点持怀疑的看法。正是这种持怀疑态度的观点，使德国哲学家康德说出下面这句著名的话：这种质疑的观点，将他从教条主义的迷梦中惊醒。

现在我在位于爱丁堡大学的我的办公室外面，站在教授诺曼·坎普·史密斯的肖像前面，他曾经是这所大学的一位著名教授。他翻译了康德最重要的一本书《纯粹理性批判》。在这本书里，康德详细解释了他的那句话是什么意思：当他从教条主义的迷梦中被惊醒时，他要做些什么。在他接触到休谟的观点之前，他曾假设哲学可以让我们贴近世界的真相。而且，他认为事实上，所有休谟之前的哲学家 都是这样假设的。但是在读完休谟的观点之后，康德意识到，我们不能只是假设，我们需要证明这一点。于是在《纯粹理性批判》中，他试图对这一观点进行证明。

他使用的证明方式非常复杂，但其基本思路是，他试图表明 “世界并不与支配思想的规则相符”这一观点是荒谬的。

所以，康德认为，休谟的观点是完全正确的，并且他还指出有一些特定的经验世界的方式无法避免的。我们必须要经历这样一个世界，它在空间中随着时间的推移而呈现，包含着所有有因果关系的事件，但康德与休谟不同的是，他认为，这些并不只是我们思考的方式，同时，这些也是世界运作的真实方式。事实上，他认为这些就是使得世界，如其所是的事实。

因此,康德认为,如果我们尝试去想象一个不具有空间、时间和因果关系这些特征，我们就没有理由相信自己的确是在想象着这个世界。在一个缺乏这些东西的世界里，我们无从知道这意味着什么。

因此，**康德试图辩称，支配我们思维运转方式的规则，也正是支配这个世界运行的规则。**这就是康德对休谟的哲学怀疑态度作出的回应。
