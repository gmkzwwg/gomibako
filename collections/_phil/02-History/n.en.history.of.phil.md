**Explanation:**
1. Historical stage of western philosophy is partitioned by paradigm shift.

## Mythos to Logos (c. 6c BCE)

**Core Problems:**

**Paradigm Shift:** Transition from mythos (genealogical, theogonic narrative) to logos (impersonal causal explanation).

**Features:**
  - **Naturalistic** - its attention is directed to nature.
  - Mostly **Hylozoistic** (Hylozoism) - it conceives nature as animated or alive.
  - **Ontological** - it inquires into the essence of things.
  - Mainly **Monistic** - it seeks to explain its phenomena by means of a single principle.
  - **Dogmatic** - it naïvely presupposes the competence of the human mind to solve the world-problem.

**Two interdependent problem about REALITY:** 
  - What is the basic`substance`, its constitution and origination.
  - How the basic substances `changes` into the familiar *object of sense*.

> *Object of sense*: the sensory experiences derived from the five senses: sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch.

**Figures:** 
  - Thales is usually named the inaugurator of `natural philosophy`.

# Pre-Socratic Philosophy: A Comprehensive Survey 

## Executive Summary  
The Pre-Socratic philosophers (6th–5th centuries BCE) inaugurated a radically new mode of inquiry into nature and human existence. Largely unmoored from mythological explanation, they sought **rational principles** (archê) underlying the cosmos, life, and knowledge【21†L43-L49】【22†L61-L68】. This intellectual revolution laid foundations for Western science and metaphysics, as these thinkers—Thales, Anaximander, Heraclitus, Parmenides, Empedocles, Anaxagoras, Democritus, and others—offered theories of matter, change, and reason that would influence Plato, Aristotle, and beyond. The surviving evidence is fragmentary and mediated through later authors (DK and Laks–Most collections), so modern reconstructions rest on careful philological and philosophical interpretation【21†L97-L105】【32†L1-L9】.

This article provides a scholarly, integrated overview of Presocratic thought from multiple angles. After a brief **historical narrative**, we examine major themes: cosmogony and ontology (the nature of reality and first principles), epistemology and method (how knowledge is acquired and the role of reason and myth), and the contrast between the various schools (Milesian monism, Eleatic philosophy, pluralism, atomism, etc.). We highlight **interpretive debates**—for example, whether the Milesians were strict material monists or proto-scientists, and how Heraclitus’ notion of logos relates to Parmenidean being—while orienting the discussion to 21st-century scholarship【22†L61-L68】【32†L1-L9】. Methodological issues of fragmentary evidence and doxography are addressed in an appendix. The goal is a coherent account that suits modern philosophical historiography, concluding with the Presocratics’ enduring significance. 

## The Milesian Physicists: Thales, Anaximander, Anaximenes  
Thales of Miletus is traditionally considered Greece’s first philosopher. Aristotle reports that Thales held water as the archê, the originating element of all things【21†L43-L49】. Though Thales’ fragments are sparse, he exemplifies the early attempt to find a single underlying substance. Anaximander, a younger Milesian, posited instead the **apeiron**, an indefinite or boundless substratum from which opposites arise and return【23†L13-L20】. His cosmology involved the earth’s equilibrium and cyclical exchanges (e.g. hot–cold) grounded in the apeiron. Anaximenes replaced the apeiron with **air** (aer) as the fundamental substance, explaining phenomena via rarefaction and condensation (“rarification produces fire, condensation produces water, earth, and stone”)【23†L37-L45】. These thinkers blended observation (astronomy, geography) with speculative cause; Aristotle later suggested that they were early *proto-scientists* seeking natural explanations, even if their surviving fragments (DK material) are brief or secondhand【23†L13-L22】. Modern scholars debate whether to read the Milesians as naive materialists or as stepwise scientific inquirers, given the lack of explicit argumentation in the testimonia【23†L41-L48】. 

## Xenophanes and Heraclitus: Critique and Logos  
Xenophanes of Colophon (c. 570–480 BCE) is often seen as a skeptic-critic of anthropomorphism. He famously argued that if horses or oxen could draw gods, they would depict gods like themselves. This suggests an early critique of human projection onto divinity. Xenophanes also advanced a concept of a single divine principle, which anticipates later monism (although his thought is cryptic in fragments). 

Heraclitus of Ephesus (c. 535–475 BCE) responded to his predecessors with a dramatic vision: the cosmos is in perpetual flux, yet governed by an underlying order (logos). Fragments reveal his central maxim that *“all things flow”* (panta rhei) and his theme of unity of opposites (e.g. “war is the father of all”), emphasizing change as fundamental【22†L79-L87】. Crucially, Heraclitus introduces *logos* as a rational principle ordering nature: “there is a logos common to all” which binds the world into a coherent whole【22†L61-L69】. His sayings are enigmatic and aphoristic; he criticizes earlier thinkers for mere accumulation of facts without understanding (DK22B40). Modern interpreters note that Heraclitus’ logos presages notions of cosmic law or reason, linking theology, physics, and ethics. 

## Parmenides and the Eleatics: Being and Reality  
Parmenides of Elea (early 5th c. BCE) represents a stark counterpoint. In a famed philosophical poem, he claims that *“what is”* (being) is eternal, unchanging, and one; by contrast, *“what is not”* (non-being, change, void) cannot be thought or spoken. The goddess’s revelation in his poem (fr. 1–2) lays out two paths of inquiry: the way of truth (being-is) and the way of opinion (world of appearances)【25†L223-L230】. According to Parmenides, sensory impressions of change and plurality are illusory; only reason can grasp the singular reality. His rigorous logic (and Zeno’s paradoxes defending it) posed a crisis: if change is impossible, how do we explain motion or multiplicity? Parmenides’ influence on Plato was profound (cf. *Republic* and *Sophist*), as Plato tried to reconcile the One of Parmenides with the many of experience. 

Later Eleatics include Zeno of Elea (c. 490–430 BCE), who formulated paradoxes of motion (Achilles and the tortoise, the arrow) to defend Parmenidean conclusions. Melissus of Samos carried the One-of-Parmenides doctrine to its limit, emphasizing endless extension of the One. These philosophers forced subsequent thinkers to grapple with the nature of space, time, and infinity.

## The Pythagorean Tradition: Number and Harmony  
Meanwhile, the Pythagorean school (c. 6th c. BCE, centered in Croton) combined mathematics, mysticism, and natural philosophy. Pythagoras himself is known (mostly through later sources) for the doctrine that *“all things are number”*: reality is fundamentally numerical and harmonious. His followers contributed to cosmology (sphericity of Earth, harmony of spheres) and ethics (rules for living). Pythagorean physics saw cosmic principles in ratios and integers. Empedocles of Acragas (c. 490–430 BCE) can be viewed as the last Pythagorean: he posited four eternal roots (earth, air, fire, water) combined by Love and separated by Strife【22†L85-L90】. Empedocles’ cycle of mixing and unmixing matter offered a pluralistic alternative to monism, and he introduced an early evolutionary vision of creatures arising from elemental combinations. Anaxagoras of Clazomenae (c. 500–428 BCE), though not Pythagorean, shared a pluralist spirit by positing infinitely many basic seeds (sperms) and a cosmic Mind (Nous) that organizes them. His work (e.g. commentaries on the sun and moon) shows an early rational astronomy.

## Atomists: Leucippus and Democritus  
Leucippus and his pupil Democritus (c. 460–370 BCE) advanced the doctrine of **atomism**. They proposed that reality ultimately consists of indivisible, eternal particles—*atoms*—moving in void【32†L1-L9】. Everything else (color, taste, life) is explained as arrangements of atoms with various shapes and motions. For example, Democritus says, “By convention sweet…by convention color; in reality atoms and void”【32†L7-L10】. This theory united physical change with unchanging constituents and anticipated scientific materialism. The atomists also held a qualitative/empirical view: quantitative differences in experience (hot/cold, soft/hard) reflect atom shapes and configurations. Though atomism did not become mainstream until Epicurus and later Lucretius, its Greek origins marked the first mechanistic account of nature.

## Later Figures: Diogenes of Apollonia and Sophists  
Diogenes of Apollonia (mid-5th c. BCE) argued that air is the intelligence (nous) that pervades the cosmos, hinting at continuity between Heraclitus and Anaxagoras. The Sophists (5th c. BCE), such as Protagoras and Gorgias, did not advance cosmology but critically examined knowledge and language (“man is the measure of all things”). Their skepticism about certainty and emphasis on rhetoric shifted the intellectual climate, setting the stage for Socrates and Plato. Although not Presocratics in the natural-philosophy sense, they interacted with and reacted to earlier theories, highlighting anthropological and epistemological issues.

## Key Themes and Methods  
Several overarching themes emerge. The **quest for archê** shows a commitment to a rational **naturalism**: gods and myths are increasingly sidelined in favor of impersonal causes. The notion of *logos* (as in Heraclitus) and the emphasis on **reasoned account** reflect a move toward philosophy as argumentative discourse. Yet mythic imagery remains—Parmenides’ allegory of Night or Empedocles’ appeal to ancient gods—indicating a fluid boundary between rational and sacred language. Epistemologically, many Presocratics distinguished between surface appearances (for mortals) and deeper truth (accessible to reason)【25†L223-L230】. This dichotomy is explicit in Parmenides’ two paths, and implicit in Empedocles’ and Democritus’ ideas that senses deceive (hot appears cold) while knowledge comes from intellect. 

Importantly, the evidence for Pre-Socratic thought is **fragmentary**. No complete works remain; we rely on later doxographers like Aristotle, Diogenes Laertius, and Simplicius【21†L97-L105】. Modern editions (Diels–Kranz, Laks–Most) organize these sources (testimonia and fragments) critically. Scholars note that these intermediaries had their own philosophical agendas, so any reconstruction must be cautious about anachronism or distortion【21†L97-L105】【25†L137-L146】. The discovery of papyri (e.g., the 1962 Derveni Papyrus, manuscripts of Empedocles) shows that new fragments can still alter our picture, reminding us that even canonical "textbook" accounts may need revision.

## Interpretive Debates  
Interpretation of Presocratic thought often hinges on contested points. *Monism vs. Pluralism*: Thales’ water and Anaximander’s apeiron suggest monism (one principle), but Empedocles and Anaxagoras clearly endorse plural elements, and the Milesians themselves likely accepted some form of qualitative change (rarefaction of air, etc.)【23†L41-L48】. Did the Milesians truly hold that one substance *persists* unchanged (Aristotle’s reading) or simply that things originate from one source? Scholars disagree (e.g. Barnes 1979 vs. Mourelatos 1997) as noted by modern commentators【23†L41-L48】. 

*Heraclitus’ Unity and Logos*: Heraclitus’ aphorisms have invited myriad readings. His appeal to a rational logos suggests a proto-rationalist outlook, but his poetic style resists systematic interpretation. Some debates center on whether he conceived the cosmos as fire in equilibrium or something more abstract. Key fragments imply a divinely ordered cosmos (logos as “objective law”【22†L61-L69】). We also lack clarity on his view of soul and knowledge (soul as fiery essence of humans【22†L109-L117】).

*Parmenidean Reality*: Interpretations of Parmenides hinge on fragment gaps. The distinction between the “Way of Truth” (Being) and “Way of Opinion” (appearances) is clear, but how much of his cosmology survives is unclear. Some argue Parmenides denied *all* change; others allow he described a mythical origin for the sensible world in the later “doxa” portion of his poem. Recent scholarship often emphasizes his logical strictures on thought (no thinking the not)【25†L223-L230】, treating the poem as a dialectical challenge rather than pure myth.

*Method and Religion*: Unlike later rationalists, many Presocratics wrote in verse or mythic guises. For example, Empedocles and Parmenides use poetry and divine imagery. Scholars debate how "mystical" these accounts are versus metaphorical. The journey and goddess in Parmenides’ proem have been linked to mystery religions (e.g. Orphic rites【25†L173-L182】), suggesting that philosophical knowledge was partly couched in religious symbolism.

## Conclusion: Legacy and Contemporary Significance  
By the 21st century, the Presocratics remain focal for understanding philosophy’s origins. They initiated empirical and logical investigation of nature, laying groundwork for later metaphysics and science. Their questions—“What is ultimate reality?” “How do we know?”—are perennial. Modern science still echoes Parmenides’ challenge of change and Heraclitus’ insight of flux in physics and cosmology. Ethically and methodologically, their critical spirit—questioning myths and authority—resonates today. 

Contemporary scholarship uses the Presocratics both to trace conceptual lineages (e.g. monism in metaphysics, scientific explanation) and to explore historiography (how ancient ideas are filtered through Plato, Aristotle, etc.)【21†L97-L105】. Key recent developments include critical editions of fragments and interdisciplinary studies (e.g. the Derveni Papyrus linking Presocratic themes with Orphism). We should approach Pre-Socratic thought with both respect for its originality and caution about our reconstructions: our picture remains provisional, built from scattered shards. Nevertheless, by synthesizing these fragments, we can still glean a remarkably coherent vision: the first philosophers dared to explain the world without gods, seeking rational principles by which to understand all.
