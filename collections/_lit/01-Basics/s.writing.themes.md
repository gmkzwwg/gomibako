| **Cultural setting |     | Fragmented political order after Carolingian collapse required local military ties; epics became ideological rallying-cries.                       |
| **Story markers    |     | Oath-swearing ceremonies, betrayal of liege, reward of fief, clash between love-loyalty and lord-loyalty.                                          |
| **Examples         |     | *The Song of Roland* (c. 1100) ‧ *Nibelungenlied* (German, c. 1200) ‧ *Beowulf* (Anglo-Saxon, earlier but retroactively read through feudal lens). |

| **Story markers    |     | Dream-visions, battle tableaux of Vices vs. Virtues, explanatory guides by an allegorical mentor.               |
| **Examples         |     | *Psychomachia* **Prudentius                                                                                     | (4 c.) ‧ *Roman de la Rose* **Guillaume de Lorris / Jean de Meun | ‧ *Pearl* (Middle English dream vision). |

| ------------------ | --- |
| **Core idea        |     | Narratives showing divine power working through holy men and women, validating faith and offering role models. |
| **Cultural setting |     | Relic cults funded churches; pilgrims sought thaumaturgic proof, making miracle tales a genre of persuasion.   |

| **Examples         |     | *Legenda Aurea / Golden Legend* **Jacob de Voragine                                                            | ‧ *Miracles of Our Lady* **Gonzalo de Berceo | ‧ *Life of Saint Catherine of Alexandria* (multiple vernacular versions). |

| **Cultural setting |     | Fusion of Celtic cauldron myth, Eucharistic theology, and crusading piety; Grail romance became an Arthurian high point. |
| **Story markers    |     | Visionary bleeding objects, tests of purity, failure of proud knights, success of chaste elect (e.g., Galahad).          |
| **Examples         |     | *Perceval, ou le Conte du Graal* **Chrétien de Troyes                                                                    | ‧ *Parzival* **Wolfram von Eschenbach | ‧ *Le Morte d’Arthur* **Sir Thomas Malory | (Book 13–17). |

| ------------------ | --- |
