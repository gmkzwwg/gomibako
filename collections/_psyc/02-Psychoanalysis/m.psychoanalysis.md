## A MECE Brief History of Psychoanalysis (Classical → Relational → Structural)

### Phase I. Classical Foundation: From Drive Theory to Structural Models (Freud)

Freud establishes psychoanalysis as a metapsychology of `drive`, `conflict`, and `repression`, formalized through the topographical model (`conscious/preconscious/unconscious`) and later the structural model (`id/ego/superego`), with Oedipus/castration functioning as the central developmental logic that organizes sexuality, prohibition, and symptom formation; clinically, free association and the interpretation of dreams, slips, and transference make the unconscious **readable as a determinate causal field** rather than a mere metaphor.

> 弗洛伊德将精神分析建立为一套关于`驱力`、`冲突`与`压抑`的元心理学：先以地形模型（`意识/前意识/无意识`）形式化，继而以结构模型（`本我/自我/超我`）重构心理机构；俄狄浦斯/阉割作为核心的发展逻辑，用以组织性、禁令与症状形成；在临床上，自由联想以及对梦、口误与移情的解释，使无意识成为一个**可读、可追溯的因果场**，而非仅是修辞性隐喻。  
> id / ˌaɪ ˈdiː / ego / ˈiːɡəʊ / superego / ˈsuːpəriːɡəʊ; ˈsjuːpəriːɡəʊ / Oedipus / ˈiːdɪpəs /

### Phase II. Early Divergences: Expanding “Depth” Beyond Freudian Drive Conflict (Jung; Adler)

Jung breaks with Freudian libido theory by relocating psychic causality in symbolic meaning and transpersonal structures, positing the collective unconscious and archetypes and treating individuation as the telos of psychic development through interpretive “amplification,” dream work, and active imagination that link inner life to mythic, religious, and cultural forms.

> 荣格脱离弗洛伊德的力比多理论，将心理因果性重新定位于象征意义与超个人结构之中：提出集体无意识与原型，并把个体化视为心理发展的目的，通过“扩充式解释”、梦分析与主动想象，把内在生命与神话、宗教及文化形式联结起来。

Adler departs from drive-conflict metapsychology toward a purposive and social teleology, construing neurosis as a compensatory style of striving shaped by inferiority and oriented toward goals, with lifestyle analysis and the ethical ideal of social interest reframing pathology as a problem of meaning, belonging, and communal adaptation.

> 阿德勒则从驱力冲突的元心理学转向目的论与社会取向：把神经症理解为由自卑所触发的补偿性奋斗与生活风格的产物，以生活风格分析与“社会兴趣”的伦理理想，重新框定病理为意义、归属与共同体适应的问题。

### Phase III. Developmental–Relational Reorientation: Ego Functions, Internal Objects, and Early Environment (Anna Freud; Klein; Winnicott)

Ego Psychology (Anna Freud, later systematized with Hartmann and others) shifts attention from drives alone to ego functions and defenses, treating defense mechanisms as lawful operations of psychic organization and making child analysis and developmental lines central to clinical assessment and technique.

> 自我心理学（安娜·弗洛伊德奠基，并由哈特曼等人进一步系统化）把关注点从“仅驱力”转向自我功能与防御：将防御机制视为心理组织的规律性操作，并使儿童分析与“发展线”的评估成为临床诊断与技术的核心。

Object Relations (Klein, alongside parallel British developments) relocates the engine of psychopathology in early internal object worlds structured by unconscious phantasy, splitting, projective identification, and the oscillation of positions (paranoid-schizoid/depressive), thereby making the management of destructiveness and reparative capacity the core mechanics of psychic growth.

> 客体关系传统（以克莱因为核心，同时存在英国内部的并行发展）把精神病理的发动机转移到早期内在客体世界：该世界由无意识幻想所结构化，并通过分裂、投射性认同及“位置”的摆动（偏执—分裂/抑郁）运作，因此把对破坏性（destructiveness）的管理能力与修复/补偿（reparation）能力视为心理成长的核心机制。

The British Independent tradition (exemplified by Winnicott) redefines development as the gradual emergence of a real self from a facilitating environment: holding and “good-enough” failure generate potential space, transitional phenomena, and the true/false self distinction, while play becomes the privileged medium through which private experience matures into shared cultural life.

> 英国独立学派（温尼科特为代表）则将发展重新定义为“真实自我”在促进性环境中逐步生成：持抱与“足够好”的可承受失败共同产生潜能空间、过渡性现象与真/假自我区分；游戏成为私人经验走向共享文化生活的特权媒介。

### Phase IV. Structuralist Reconstruction and the Cultural Turn: Language, Lack, and Topology (Lacan)

Lacan re-reads Freud through Saussurean linguistics and post-Hegelian dialectics, arguing that the subject is produced by the signifier (primacy of the signifier, the Big Other, the Name-of-the-Father) and therefore constitutively divided, with lack functioning as the structural motor of desire and jouissance marking the limit where the Real resists symbolization; his later topological models (RSI, Borromean knot, Möbius/Klein surfaces) formalize how psychic consistency depends on knotting rather than harmony, and the aim of analysis becomes traversing fantasy and assuming the sinthome as a singular mode of enjoying and stabilizing one’s structure.

> 拉康通过索绪尔语言学与后黑格尔辩证法重读弗洛伊德，主张主体由能指生产（能指优先性、大他者、父之名），因此主体在结构上被分裂，“缺失”成为欲望的结构发动机，而享乐标记实在界对符号化的极限抵抗；其后期拓扑模型（RSI、博罗米恩结、莫比乌斯带/克莱因瓶等）将心理一致性形式化为“打结”而非“和谐”，并把分析的目标界定为穿越幻想与承担 sinthome 作为个体化的享乐与结构稳定方式。

## The Subversive Legacy: A Critical Mapping of Psychoanalytic Ruptures Across Modern Disciplines 颠覆性的遗产：对精神分析在现代学科中“断裂效应”的批判性制图

### Introduction: From Clinical Technique to Civilizational Infrastructure

This analysis reconstructs a single logic chain: psychoanalysis migrates from a clinic-centered practice of interpreting psychic conflict into a generalizable apparatus for producing *knowledge of subjectivity*—and, with it, new institutional competencies for governing suffering, childhood, culture, and meaning. The crucial mechanism of diffusion is not the export of “theory” as such, but the portability of a distinctive methodological stance: (i) symptoms and practices are treated as *legible formations* rather than mere errors; (ii) causality is displaced from surface behavior to hidden determinants (the Unconscious, conflict, fantasy, developmental position); (iii) expertise shifts from measuring bodies to interpreting relational and symbolic economies (cathexis, identification, imago, archetype, signifier chains); and (iv) institutions reorganize around this new ontology of the human.

Within that chain, each thinker below effects a rupture in an external field by destabilizing its prior assumptions about what counts as an object, a cause, and an intervention. For each, I specify (1) the pre-existing paradigm (“Before”), (2) the rupture (“Disruption”), and (3) the durable institutional/practical change (“After”).



### I. Sigmund Freud on Clinical Psychiatry

#### 1) The Pre-existing Paradigm (Before): Somatic Etiology and Organic Reduction

Late nineteenth-century clinical psychiatry and adjacent neurology were dominated by models in which disorder was anchored in organic lesion, degeneration, or constitutional defect; where psychological phenomena appeared, they were often treated as epiphenomenal, malingering, or secondary to bodily pathology. “Hysteria” and functional symptoms posed a persistent anomaly, frequently negotiated through neurological description, moral judgment, or speculative physiology.

#### 2) The Rupture (Disruption): Psychogenic Causality and the Talking Cure

Freud’s intervention is disruptive because it reclassifies a major domain of suffering as *psychogenic* and therefore clinically tractable through speech. In *Studies in Hysteria* (1895), Freud and Breuer explicitly propose a psychological mechanism for functional disorders, shifting etiological gravity from lesion to conflict and memory, and from the body as primary site to the Unconscious as causal domain. ([PMC][1]) The “talking cure” crystallizes as a technique whose wager is methodological: verbalization is not mere report; it is an instrument that reconfigures symptom formation by re-binding affect and reconstructing meaning. ([ScienceDirect][2])

What changes in psychiatry is not only treatment but ontology: the patient becomes a speaking subject whose symptoms have a logic; the clinic becomes a scene where causality is inferred from resistance, association, and transference rather than solely from physical signs. This displaces the psychiatrist from a primarily classificatory physician into an interpreter of libidinal economy and conflict.

#### 3) The Lasting Institutional/Practical Change (After): Psychotherapy as Psychiatric Competence

The most durable transformation is the institutionalization of psychotherapy within psychiatric practice and training, including the long period in which psychodynamic ideas substantially shaped diagnostic sensibilities and clinical management. A historical trace of this institutional uptake is visible in later psychiatric nosology and clinical orientations that explicitly accommodated psychoanalytic frameworks. ([Journal of Psychopathology][3]) Even where biological psychiatry reasserts dominance, the “talking cure” remains a constitutive alternative infrastructure: outpatient psychotherapy, psychodynamic case formulation, and the psychiatric division of labor between pharmacological management and interpretive care.



### II. Carl Jung on Comparative Mythology and Religious Studies

#### 1) The Pre-existing Paradigm (Before): Descriptive Folklore and Historicist Cataloguing

Comparative mythology and the study of religion often proceeded via philological reconstruction, motif catalogues, diffusionist histories, and ethnographic description. Myths were treated primarily as cultural artifacts to be classified by origin, transmission, and variation—objects of *external* description.

#### 2) The Rupture (Disruption): Archetype and the Collective Unconscious as Structural Constraint

Jung’s rupture is the claim that mythic material is not merely cultural residue but the phenomenal surface of transpersonal psychic structures: archetypes (Archetype) anchored in a collective unconscious. Jung explicitly theorizes archetypes and their correlate, the collective unconscious, as foundational—thereby offering a structural rather than merely descriptive account of recurring mythic forms. ([Association of Jungian Analysts][4])

Methodologically, this transforms the comparative enterprise: comparison no longer aims only to trace diffusion or historical lineage; it aims to read cross-cultural recurrence as evidence of underlying psychic invariants. The myth becomes a symbolic solution to universal problems of subjectivity (initiation, death, sexuality, authority) rather than a local tale with a local genealogy. This reorients religious studies toward *hermeneutics of symbolic form* and toward a quasi-anthropological psychology of the sacred.

#### 3) The Lasting Institutional/Practical Change (After): Archetypal Hermeneutics and a New Comparative Style

Jungian categories become operational in the practice of mythological criticism and popular-comparative synthesis (notably in the “monomyth” style), providing an institutional bridge between psychology, religious studies, and humanities interpretation. Scholarly discussion of Joseph Campbell’s theoretical posture, for instance, explicitly situates archetypes in relation to Jungian premises, indicating how “archetype” becomes a working comparative tool rather than a purely clinical concept. ([jstor.org][5]) The lasting change is a widened disciplinary permission structure: myths can be read as structured articulations of psychic universals (archetypal patterns), not merely as folklore to be indexed.



### III. Alfred Adler on Educational Pedagogy and Social Work

#### 1) The Pre-existing Paradigm (Before): Authoritarian Schooling and Individual Defect Models

Educational practice in many modernizing contexts relied on discipline, hierarchy, and punishment-oriented control; misbehavior was moralized; “failure” was attributed to deficiency, laziness, or inherited defect. Early social interventions often oscillated between moral reform and paternalistic management.

#### 2) The Rupture (Disruption): Inferiority, Compensation, and Social Interest as Pedagogical Categories

Adler’s disruption is a conceptual re-description of the child’s conduct: misbehavior and scholastic failure are read as purposive responses to perceived inferiority and threats to belonging, rather than as sheer disobedience. The “inferiority complex” becomes a practical lens for educators and caseworkers—translating discipline problems into problems of significance, recognition, and communal integration. Adler’s “social interest” (*Gemeinschaftsgefühl*) then supplies a normative axis: education is reimagined less as obedience-production and more as the cultivation of cooperative membership.

Crucially, Adler’s ideas did not remain abstract: he helped catalyze school counseling and child guidance infrastructures. A historical educational review notes that Adler was commissioned to establish child guidance and school counseling centers across Vienna state schools, embedding his child-training program into educational governance rather than leaving it as private therapy. ([ERIC][6])

#### 3) The Lasting Institutional/Practical Change (After): Counseling, Democratic Classroom Management, and Social-Work Uptake

The durable institutional change is the normalization of counseling and psychosocial interpretation within schooling and social work: the educator becomes partly a diagnostician of social belonging and self-esteem economies, and the social worker becomes partly a clinician of purposive adaptation. Contemporary social-work scholarship explicitly frames Adler’s Individual Psychology as applicable to social work practice and education, reflecting the long afterlife of Adlerian premises in institutional training and intervention. ([PMC][7]) In pedagogy, Adlerian lineages (often via Dreikurs) operationalize non-authoritarian management: discipline is reframed as the engineering of cooperative climates rather than the imposition of fear.



### IV. Anna Freud on Family Law and Child Welfare

#### 1) The Pre-existing Paradigm (Before): Parental Right, Custodial Sovereignty, and the Child as Legal Object

Historically, many legal regimes treated children as subordinated to paternal authority or household sovereignty; the state intervened episodically through doctrines such as *parens patriae* (literally “parent of the nation”), legitimating protective jurisdiction over children. ([ウィキペディア][8]) The gradual emergence of “welfare” reasoning reoriented custody and protection toward the child, but its operational content—what the child *needs*—remained contestable and dependent on available expertise.

#### 2) The Rupture (Disruption): Developmental Need as a Justiciable Reality

Anna Freud’s disruption, at the level of institutional practice, is the insertion of *developmental psychology* (developmental lines, ego capacities, developmental disharmony) into the practical vocabulary of child welfare—making “harm” and “interest” legible not only as physical outcomes but as developmental trajectories. This is not merely a theoretical nuance; it is a new administrative ontology: the child is constituted as a developing subject whose psychological needs can be observed, profiled, and forecast.

Her work is closely associated with the institutionalization of direct observation and organized child therapeutic services (e.g., the Hampstead War Nurseries and later clinical infrastructures), which help relocate child welfare from ad hoc moral judgment to systematic developmental assessment. ([PubMed][9])

A critical clarification is necessary: the “best interests”/“welfare” principle has legal roots that predate Anna Freud and develop through jurisprudential evolution rather than being “implemented” by psychoanalysis alone (e.g., historical accounts of the welfare principle in custody law). ([digitalcommons.wayne.edu][10]) The psychoanalytic rupture lies less in inventing the standard than in *supplying its developmental content*—what, concretely, counts as the child’s welfare once welfare becomes the court’s declared aim.

#### 3) The Lasting Institutional/Practical Change (After): Expert Developmental Assessment and Child-Centered Operationalization

The enduring practical change is the routinization of child-development expertise within child welfare systems: social services, clinical teams, and (in many jurisdictions) custody and protection proceedings increasingly rely on psychological assessment frameworks to operationalize “welfare.” The late-modern extension of this trajectory is visible in contemporary scholarship on how developmental and attachment-oriented research enters court contexts, evidencing an institutionalized expectation that children’s needs are empirically and clinically assessable. ([Taylor & Francis Online][11]) The child ceases to be a passive stake in parental contestation and becomes an administratively represented developmental subject.



### V. Melanie Klein on Art Criticism and Aesthetics

#### 1) The Pre-existing Paradigm (Before): Formalism and the Autonomy of Aesthetic Value

A significant strand of modern aesthetics treated the artwork as an autonomous object whose value could be analyzed through form, style, and medium-specific properties; psychology, when invoked, often remained biographical or impressionistic. The artwork’s meaning was anchored in intentional design or formal organization rather than in deep psychic economy.

#### 2) The Rupture (Disruption): Depressive Position and Reparation as Generative Motives

Kleinian thought disrupts aesthetic practice by relocating artistic creation from formal innovation to psychic necessity: art becomes a scene where internal object relations are repaired and guilt is metabolized. The depressive position—where love and hate are recognized as directed toward the same object—establishes a new ontology of creativity: creation is not primarily embellishment but *reparation* (restoration of the damaged internal object). This is not an ancillary “interpretation”; it reorganizes the critic’s methodological presuppositions about why art exists.

In psychoanalytic aesthetics influenced by Klein, this move is explicit: Hanna Segal argues that Klein’s concept of the depressive position enables an account of the aesthetic impulse in terms of reparative wishes and restoration. ([bgsp.edu][12])

#### 3) The Lasting Institutional/Practical Change (After): Reparative Criticism and Object-Relational Aesthetic Method

The durable change is the legitimization of object-relations-based criticism as a method within art interpretation and aesthetic theory: critics gain a vocabulary for reading form as the trace of unconscious fantasy-work and for treating reception as a replay of object relations. The artwork becomes a reparative artifact within a libidinal economy, and aesthetic judgment becomes partially a judgment about psychic integration (capacity for ambivalence, mourning, repair), not only about beauty or technique.



### VI. Donald Winnicott on Pediatric Nursing and Sociology

#### 1) The Pre-existing Paradigm (Before): Rigid Childcare Regimes and Externalist Socialization Models

Mid-century childcare norms often emphasized schedules, behavioral compliance, and technique-driven mothering—approaches compatible with institutional routines but frequently indifferent to the infant’s experiential continuity. In social theory, “culture” could be treated as a macro-structure that imprints subjects, with limited attention to the micro-genesis of subjectivity in early relational environments.

#### 2) The Rupture (Disruption): Good-Enough Care and Potential Space as Infrastructure of the Social

Winnicott disrupts pediatric and nursing practice by redefining successful care as *good-enough* adaptation rather than perfect control. The concept of the “good-enough mother” rejects the fantasy of optimal technique and reframes caregiving as a graduated failure calibrated to the infant’s growing capacity—an explicit challenge to rigid childcare ideology. ([PMC][13])

Simultaneously, Winnicott’s “potential space” (transitional space) relocates culture from a purely external domain into an intermediate area of experience where play, symbolization, and shared meaning arise. This is a sociological rupture: culture becomes continuous with early object relations; the social is built in transitional phenomena before it is codified in institutions. Scholarship in cultural and literary studies continues to treat “potential space” and “cultural experience” as central Winnicottian bridges between psyche and culture. ([metacriticjournal.com][14])

#### 3) The Lasting Institutional/Practical Change (After): Relational Care Standards and Micro-Foundations of Culture

In pediatric nursing and allied childcare professions, Winnicott’s legacy is the normalization of responsive, holding-environment-oriented care: the unit of intervention becomes the caregiver–infant system rather than the infant alone. In sociology and cultural theory, the lasting effect is methodological: analyses of institutions and cultural practices increasingly permit an account of how subjectivity is formed in “in-between” spaces of play, not merely imposed by social structures—thereby integrating object-relations into the ontological foundations of culture.



### VII. Jacques Lacan on Literary Theory and Film Studies

#### 1) The Pre-existing Paradigm (Before): Unified Author, Transparent Meaning, Coherent Spectator

Large segments of literary criticism presupposed that texts were expressions of authorial intention and that meaning could be stabilized through interpretive mastery; similarly, early film theory could treat spectatorship as a largely coherent perceptual experience with relatively stable identification structures.

#### 2) The Rupture (Disruption): The Unconscious as Language—Subjectivity as Split by the Signifier

Lacan’s rupture is the linguistic re-foundation of the Unconscious: it is “structured like a language,” implying that subjectivity is produced and divided by signifiers, not grounded in a unified interior self. ([plato.stanford.edu][15]) This reorients method: interpretation shifts from decoding hidden content to tracking signifying chains, metonymy and metaphor, and the structural places from which desire speaks. The author becomes less a sovereign origin than a function within discourse; the spectator becomes less a unified viewer than a split subject produced by cinematic apparatus and identification.

Film theory’s Lacanian encounter makes this methodological shift explicit. Scholarly work on Lacanian film theory notes that the field’s engagement often centers on spectator identification and the problematic fantasy of a “gaze of mastery,” precisely the illusion Lacan renders structurally unstable. ([jstor.org][16])

#### 3) The Lasting Institutional/Practical Change (After): Apparatus Theory, Spectatorship Analysis, and Anti-Intentionalist Criticism

The durable change is institutional: entire research programs in literary theory and film studies reorganize around the primacy of language, desire, and subject formation. In literature, the interpretive object becomes textual production of subject positions; in film, apparatus and spectatorship become central methodological foci rather than secondary considerations. The Lacanian rupture thereby entrenches a broadly anti-humanist or post-humanist orientation: meaning and subjectivity are effects of symbolic structures, not possessions of self-transparent individuals.



### Conclusion: Psychoanalysis as a Portable Technology of Rupture

Across these cases, the clinic functions as the originating laboratory for an epistemic style that becomes civilizational infrastructure. Freud authorizes speech as therapy and the Unconscious as etiology, enabling psychiatry to treat meaning as a causal force. ([PMC][1]) Jung exports structural invariants (archetypes) into myth and religion, converting comparison into a search for deep form. ([Association of Jungian Analysts][4]) Adler turns pedagogy and social work away from punitive sovereignty toward a social ontology of belonging and compensation, institutionalized in counseling and guidance. ([ERIC][6]) Anna Freud inserts developmental need into welfare practice, helping operationalize child-centered standards by making the child’s psyche administratively legible—even as the legal “welfare principle” has older jurisprudential roots. ([digitalcommons.wayne.edu][10]) Klein reframes art as reparative work within object relations, reorganizing aesthetics around depressive anxiety and restoration. ([bgsp.edu][12]) Winnicott revolutionizes childcare by normalizing good-enough holding and gives sociology a micro-foundation for culture in transitional space. ([PMC][13]) Lacan completes the outward movement by making language the infrastructure of the psyche, transforming interpretive disciplines through a theory of the split subject and the signifier’s rule. ([plato.stanford.edu][15])

The “subversive legacy” is therefore not reducible to a set of doctrines. It is the migration of a method that changes what institutions believe is real—symptom as meaningful, myth as structural, misbehavior as purposive, childhood as developmental, art as reparative, care as holding, interpretation as signifier-tracking. Psychoanalysis becomes, in effect, a cross-disciplinary machine for producing new ontological commitments about persons—and for redesigning practices to match those commitments.

If you want, I can add a final synthetic “map” that explicitly tracks (a) which psychoanalytic concept became the external field’s new *unit of analysis*, (b) what older unit it displaced, and (c) which institutional sites (clinics, schools, courts, museums, journals) stabilized the change.

### 引言：从临床技术到文明基础设施

本文旨在重建一条单一而连贯的“逻辑链”（logic chain）：精神分析（psychoanalysis）从以诊室为中心的冲突解释技术，迁移为一种可跨领域移植的“主体性”（Subjectivity）知识装置，并由此为治理痛苦、童年、文化与意义提供新的制度化能力。其扩散的关键并非“理论细节”的输出，而在于一种可携带的方法论姿态：
(1) 症状与实践被视为可读的形成物（legible formations），而非单纯错误；
(2) 因果性从强调表层行为转向潜在决定因素（无意识 Unconscious、冲突 conflict、幻想 fantasy、发展位置 developmental position）；
(3) 专业性从“测量身体”转向“阐释关系与符号经济”（symbolic economy），例如投注（Cathexis）、认同（Identification）、意象（Imago）、原型（Archetype）、能指链（signifier chains）；
(4) 相关制度据此围绕一种新的人的本体论（ontology of the human）重组其对象、方法与干预逻辑。

在这条链条中，以下每位思想家都在某一外部领域造成“断裂”（rupture）：他们动摇了该领域关于何为对象、何为原因、何为干预的既定假设。每一节均按三段结构展开：
(1) 既有范式（Before），(2) 断裂（Disruption），(3) 持久的制度/实践变迁（After）。



### 一、西格蒙德·弗洛伊德（Sigmund Freud）对临床精神病学（Clinical Psychiatry）

#### 1) 既有范式（Before）：躯体病因与有机还原论（organic reductionism）

19世纪末的临床精神病学与相邻的神经学（neurology）长期受“器质性病灶”“退化”“体质缺陷”等模型支配：当心理因素被纳入视野时，常被视为附带现象、装病，或仅是身体病理的次级结果。“歇斯底里”（hysteria）与功能性症状构成顽固异常点，通常通过神经学描述、道德评判或推测性生理解释来安置。

#### 2) 断裂（Disruption）：“言谈治疗”（Talking Cure）与无意识病因（etiology of the unconscious）

弗洛伊德的颠覆性在于：他将一大类痛苦重新分类为心理生成（psychogenic），从而在原则上可被“言说”所治疗。其临床赌注是方法论意义上的：语言不是单纯报告，而是能改变症状形成的操作工具——通过重新“束缚”（binding）情感（affect）、重组意义结构，使症状不再仅是身体的失灵，而是可被阐释的冲突产物。

由此，精神病学发生的变化不仅是疗法更替，更是本体论转移：患者成为“说话的主体”（speaking subject），其症状具有内在逻辑；临床场景则从身体征象的观察与分类，转向通过阻抗（resistance）、自由联想（free association）与移情（transference）来推断因果。精神科医生的角色由主要的分类性医生，部分转型为“力比多经济”（libidinal economy）与冲突的解释者。

#### 3) 持久变迁（After）：心理治疗成为精神病学的制度性能力

最深远的制度后果，是心理治疗（psychotherapy）在精神科实践与训练体系中的制度化：门诊心理治疗、动力学个案公式化（psychodynamic case formulation）、以及药物管理与解释性照护之间的分工结构。即便在生物精神病学重新占据主导的时期，“言谈治疗”仍作为替代性的临床基础设施持续存在。



### 二、卡尔·荣格（Carl Jung）对比较神话学与宗教学（Comparative Mythology & Religious Studies）

#### 1) 既有范式（Before）：描述性民俗学与历史主义编目

比较神话学与宗教研究常以语文学重建、母题目录、传播/扩散史与民族志描述为主。神话多被视为文化人工制品，其分析目标是分类其起源、传播与变体——一种以“外部描述”为核心的对象化研究。

#### 2) 断裂（Disruption）：集体无意识（collective unconscious）与原型结构（Archetypal structure）

荣格的断裂在于：神话材料不再仅是文化残余，而被视为跨个体、跨历史的心理结构之显现；“原型”（Archetype）与“集体无意识”（collective unconscious）成为解释复现模式的结构性约束。方法论上，这改变了比较的目的：比较不再主要用于追踪扩散或谱系，而用于把跨文化复现读作“深层形式”的证据。神话因此从地方故事转化为主体性问题（死亡、性、权威、入门/启蒙等）的象征性解决方案。

#### 3) 持久变迁（After）：原型诠释学（archetypal hermeneutics）与新的比较风格

荣格式范畴为宗教研究与人文学科提供了可操作的比较工具：允许研究者把神话读作对普遍心理结构的编码，而非仅是民俗档案。其持久影响不只体现在学术内部，也体现在“结构化叙事比较”的普及化风格中：神话的可比性被理解为“原型结构”的可比性，比较方法由此获得一种新的合法性。



### 三、阿尔弗雷德·阿德勒（Alfred Adler）对教育学与社会工作（Educational Pedagogy & Social Work）

#### 1) 既有范式（Before）：威权学校与个体缺陷模型

现代化进程中的许多教育实践依赖纪律、等级与惩罚性控制；不良行为被道德化；“失败”被归因于能力缺陷、懒惰或遗传性不足。早期社会干预则在道德改造与家长式管理之间摆动。

#### 2) 断裂（Disruption）：自卑情结（Inferiority Complex）、补偿（compensation）与社会兴趣（social interest）

阿德勒的断裂是一种“再描述”（redescription）：儿童的违纪与学业失败被理解为对“自卑感”与归属威胁的目的性回应（purposive response），而非单纯不服从。自卑情结成为教育与个案工作中的实践透镜：纪律问题被改写为意义、承认与共同体融入的问题。与之配套的“社会兴趣”（social interest；德语 *Gemeinschaftsgefühl*）提供规范轴线：教育被设想为合作性成员资格的培育，而非服从生产。

#### 3) 持久变迁（After）：学校辅导、非威权课堂管理与社会工作吸纳

制度层面的持久变化是：辅导与心理社会解释进入学校与社会工作常规机制。教师与社工被赋予一种新的专业对象——儿童的归属经济、自尊组织与目的性策略。课堂管理的实践逻辑由惩罚与恐惧转向“合作气候”的工程化建构，社会工作也更系统地把个体困难置于社会关系与意义结构中理解。



### 四、安娜·弗洛伊德（Anna Freud）对家庭法与儿童福利（Family Law & Child Welfare）

#### 1) 既有范式（Before）：父母权利、监护主权与儿童的法律客体化

在较长历史段落中，儿童常被置于父权或家庭主权之下，国家介入多是例外性的保护性管辖。即便“福利”话语逐步进入监护与保护领域，其操作性内容——儿童“需要什么”——仍高度依赖社会可用的专业知识与评估工具。

#### 2) 断裂（Disruption）：发展需要（developmental needs）的可裁判化与儿童的“发展主体”建构

安娜·弗洛伊德在制度实践层面的断裂，不在于单独“发明”某项法律原则，而在于把发展心理学（developmental psychology）的对象与指标带入儿童福利的行政与专业语言：伤害与利益不再仅被理解为身体后果，也被理解为发展轨迹（developmental trajectories）。这是一种新的行政本体论：儿童被构成（constituted）为一个正在发展、可观察、可剖面化（profiled）、可预测风险的主体。

其关键贡献在于：把系统观察、儿童治疗与发展评估转化为可被机构采用的实践程序，从而使“以儿童为中心”的标准获得可操作的内容（operational content）。简言之：法律从抽象地诉诸儿童利益，转向依赖发展剖面与需求评估来具体化“利益”之含义。

#### 3) 持久变迁（After）：专家发展评估的常规化与儿童中心的制度操作

持久效果是：发展与心理评估成为儿童福利系统的常规要件，社会服务与跨专业团队越来越以临床—发展框架来操作化“福利/最佳利益”。儿童不再只是父母争执的被动赌注，而成为可被行政代表与专业阐释的“发展主体”（developmental subject）。



### 五、梅兰妮·克莱因（Melanie Klein）对艺术批评与美学（Art Criticism & Aesthetics）

#### 1) 既有范式（Before）：形式主义（formalism）与审美价值的自律性

现代美学的重要脉络将作品视为自律对象，其价值可通过形式、风格与媒介特性分析；心理学若被引入，常停留在传记化或印象式阐释。作品意义多被锚定于意图与形式组织，而非深层心理经济。

#### 2) 断裂（Disruption）：抑郁位置（Depressive Position）与修复（Reparation）作为创作驱力

克莱因式断裂在于：艺术创作被从形式创新的逻辑转移为心理必需性（psychic necessity）的逻辑。抑郁位置标示一种结构条件：主体承认爱与恨指向同一客体，从而产生内疚、哀悼与修复冲动。艺术因此被理解为“修复性劳动”（reparative work）：不是装饰性的生产，而是对受损内部客体的恢复与重建。

这并非对作品追加“心理解释”，而是改变批评方法的前提：作品不只是形式对象，也是客体关系（object relations）的结晶；形式不只是美的组织，也是无意识幻想劳动（fantasy-work）的痕迹。

#### 3) 持久变迁（After）：修复性批评（reparative criticism）与客体关系美学方法

持久变化是：客体关系取向（object-relational）在艺术阐释中获得方法合法性。批评不再仅判定“美”或“技巧”，而把审美冲动理解为主体整合能力（承受矛盾情感、哀悼、修复）的表现。作品成为力比多经济中的修复性人工制品，审美判断因此部分地转化为对心理整合与修复工程的判断。



### 六、唐纳德·温尼科特（Donald Winnicott）对儿科护理与社会学（Pediatric Nursing & Sociology）

#### 1) 既有范式（Before）：僵硬育儿体制与外在化社会化模型

中期现代的育儿规范常强调时间表、行为顺从与技术化母职——这类取向适合机构管理，却经常忽视婴儿的经验连续性。在社会理论中，“文化”常被视为宏观结构对主体的刻印，较少追问主体性如何在早期关系环境中微观生成。

#### 2) 断裂（Disruption）：“足够好的母亲”（Good-Enough Mother）与潜在空间（Potential Space）

温尼科特对儿科与护理实践的断裂，是将“成功照料”重新定义为足够好（good-enough）的适应，而非完美控制：照料者并非以技术实现零失误，而是在婴儿能力增长中“恰当失败”（graduated failure），使婴儿逐步获得自我整合与现实承受力。这直接冲击了僵硬育儿意识形态及其规训性标准。

同时，“潜在空间”（Potential Space；亦称过渡空间 transitional space）把文化从纯外部领域迁移为一种“中介经验区”（intermediate area of experience）：游戏（play）、象征化与共享意义在此生成。社会学意义上的断裂由此出现：文化并非先在制度，再进入主体；文化在早期客体关系的“之间”（in-between）被建构，之后才被制度化与编码化。

#### 3) 持久变迁（After）：关系性照护标准与文化的微观基础

在儿科护理及相关儿童照护专业中，温尼科特的遗产是：以“抱持环境”（holding environment）为核心的关系性照护规范化，干预单位从“婴儿个体”转为“照料者—婴儿系统”。在社会学与文化理论中，其持久效应是方法论的：研究得以把制度与文化实践的根基追溯到过渡空间中的游戏与象征化过程，从而把客体关系引入文化的本体论基础。



### 七、雅克·拉康（Jacques Lacan）对文学理论与电影研究（Literary Theory & Film Studies）

#### 1) 既有范式（Before）：统一作者、透明意义与连贯观众

文学批评的很大部分预设文本是作者意图的表达，意义可通过解释性掌握而稳定；早期电影理论也可能把观影经验视为相对统一的知觉过程，认同结构较为稳定。

#### 2) 断裂（Disruption）：无意识“像语言一样被结构化”（structured like a language）

拉康的断裂是对无意识的语言学奠基：无意识“像语言一样被结构化”（“structured like a language”），这意味着主体性不是一个统一的内在实体，而是由能指（signifier）生产并分裂（split）出来的效果。方法论因此转向：解释不再主要是“解码隐藏内容”，而是追踪能指链、隐喻/换喻（Metaphor/Metonymy）机制，以及欲望从何种结构位置发声。作者不再是主权性起源，而更像话语功能；观众亦不再是统一观看者，而是被电影装置与认同机制生产出来的分裂主体。

在电影研究中，这一转向促成对观众认同（spectator identification）、凝视（gaze）与“掌控幻觉”（fantasy of mastery）的系统分析：观影被理解为主体在符号结构中的被定位过程，而非纯粹感知或意图接收。

#### 3) 持久变迁（After）：装置理论（apparatus theory）、观众研究与反意图论批评

其制度性后果是：文学理论与电影研究中一系列研究计划围绕语言、欲望与主体形成重组。文学研究的对象转为文本如何生产主体位置；电影研究的方法重心转向装置与观众性，而非把这些视为附属维度。拉康式断裂在更广层面上巩固了一种反人本主义（anti-humanist）或后人本主义（post-humanist）倾向：意义与主体性是符号结构的效应，而非自明个人的财产。



### 结语：精神分析作为“可移植的断裂技术”（portable technology of rupture）

贯穿上述谱系，诊室并非精神分析的终点，而是其知识样式的起点：一种能够改变制度“相信什么是真实”的方法论。弗洛伊德使言说成为治疗，使无意识成为病因，从而把意义纳入精神病学因果。荣格把原型结构引入神话与宗教，把比较从谱系学转为深层形式学。阿德勒把教育与社会工作从惩罚性主权转向归属与补偿的社会本体论，并在辅导与指导体系中制度化。安娜·弗洛伊德为儿童中心的福利与裁判提供发展内容，使儿童以发展主体的方式进入行政与司法的可见性。克莱因把艺术的生成动机重写为抑郁位置中的修复劳动，使美学方法承认内在客体关系的经济。温尼科特将育儿从僵硬技术转向足够好抱持，并为社会学提供文化的微观生成基础：潜在空间。拉康最终把语言确立为精神的基础设施，使解释性学科围绕能指链与分裂主体重组其方法。

因此，“颠覆性的遗产”不是一组教条，而是一个跨学科的再配置机制：症状成为意义性结构，神话成为深层形式，失范成为目的性策略，童年成为发展剖面对象，艺术成为修复性工程，照护成为抱持系统，解释成为能指追踪。精神分析由此成为一种横跨现代学科的“本体论重编译器”：它改变对象，改变因果，进而改变制度实践的设计原则。

## 精神分析入门

### 什么是精神分析

什么是**精神分析**？

- 精神分析是这样一门学科，研究以个人在早年跟父母亲的关系中间，是怎样**形成人格**，以及成年之后，早年形成的**人格对其的影响**。
- “人类教会了别人如何对待自己。”我们可以利用跟其他人在一起的感受，**了解这个人对我们做了什么**，以及他们人际交往的模式。
- 人类从出生起，都需要学会很多自我保护机制。精神分析的主要内容之一就是研究人类如何**保护自己**。

精神分析的**发展历程**？

- 弗洛伊德是精神分析的创始人和初学者。
- 从生物学角度定义了一个人为什么活着，即人类活着从事各种活动的动力的来自什么，即**力比多和攻击驱力的满足**。
- 由于过于偏向生物学视角，许多弟子反对弗洛伊德，如荣格、弗洛姆。他们认为人活着是为了满足关系的需要。
- 沙利文将精神分析社会化，但不够彻底。
- 克莱因提出了**现代精神分析的客体关系理论**，成为了经典精神分析与现代精神分析的分水岭。

**力比多**（libido）？

- 即性驱力，这里不是指生殖意义上的性，而是泛指**创造、愉快、亲密、温暖……等美好的感受**。

**攻击驱力**？

- 具有对他人有意挑衅、侵犯或对事物的有意损毁、破坏等心理倾向和行为。泛指**竞争、追求卓越、自我攻击、毁坏他人、破坏社会……”等意愿**。
- 攻击是用来掩盖亲密的，害怕距离过近，以致彼此双方都消失自我边界，所以需要攻击。

**关系**？

- 客体关系理论认为，人活着是为了寻找跟他人的链接。
- 实验研究显示：早年被父母强烈忽略的人在成年之后，会有莫名其妙的全身疼痛或者某个部位疼痛，仿佛被打，虚拟了一个糟糕的关系。精神分析的定律为：**再糟糕的关系也比没有关系好**。

克莱因的关系理论与弗洛伊德的驱力理论冲突吗？

- 现代精神分析理论家倾向于整合二者。在生物学角度采用驱力理论，在社会化角度采用关系理论。

精神分析的**四个驱力**：力比多、攻击性、关系、自恋（精神分析最基础的一级词汇）

精神分析区分出的**三类人**：严重的精神病、人格障碍、神经症（即正常人）。

- 这是一个连续谱，没有严格界限。
- 边缘性人格障碍即处于人格障碍和精神分裂症之间。
- 精神分裂和人格障碍的本质区别是是否能区分现实和幻想。

正常人为何被视为神经症？

1. 只要有神经质性冲突，即为神经症状态。
2. 神经质性冲突，即俄狄浦斯冲突，主要有三类：生和死，男和女，成功和惩罚。

精神分析的价值？

- 育儿学、人格鉴赏学、认识人性、认识自己

精神分析的特点？

- 因果论观点。认为同年的经历决定人的性格。关键理论：移情、强迫性重复。
- 把意识分成不同层面，并研究潜意识（Unconsciousness）层面的东西。

精神分析的目标：使人超越过去对自己的限定，过没有被限定的生活，更多的重视当下生活。

经典精神分析、客体关系理论、自体心理学的异同：
1. 经典精神分析最核心的理论是俄狄浦斯情节，是三个人之间的关系，父母子。
2. 客体关系理论讨论母子二人的关系，父亲成了背景。
3. 自体心理学主要研究自恋，一个人跟自己的关系，母亲成了孩子成长的背景。


### 早年核心人格的形成

人类的核心人格形成于非常早期：

- 弗洛伊德认为，6 岁时人的中枢神经发育完全。即“6 岁之后没有新鲜事”
- 克莱因和科胡特等人认为，核心人格在前语言期（两岁以前）就已经确定了。后续则改为 18 个月、4-6 个月就完成了心理整合。

自闭状态：初生至一个月。处于原始的、虚幻的无指向的状态。这是原始的自恋状态，基本上没有客体指向。

- 如果在此阶段发育受损，则无法脱离自恋的壳，即“儿童孤独症”。
- 即使早年良好的父母和孩子的关系使孩子形成健康的核心人格，以后的阶段中出现重大创伤，会退行到早年。

俄狄浦斯冲突主要研究：对成功的渴望，以及潜意识里面对成功后可能面临惩罚的恐惧。

【案例】用嘴体现攻击性的行为：唠叨，如父母对孩子。

- 这是因为他们的力比多的表达停留在口欲期（力比多和攻击性同时出现）。
- 他们跟世界的链接通过嘴巴，唠叨实际上使用语言对他人进行心理强奸。

【案例】游戏成瘾者：

- 孩子可以通过多种方式表达内心强大的攻击性，如学习成绩、打架。打游戏是一种高级别的攻击性的表达。
- 游戏成瘾者无法生活自理，他们被老师、父母过度攻击后，把游戏当成了自己的避难所。电子游戏在当代社会具有拯救孩子、避免精神病的作用。有高度的保护孩子的作用。

### 精神分析中的抑郁症、强迫症、焦虑症

> 国际上已取消神经衰弱的称法，改为抑郁症、强迫症、焦虑症。

抑郁症、焦虑症、强迫症，在精神分析学说中，区别是其**防御族不同**（心理防御的重点不同）。

**抑郁症**的特点：

1. 抑郁症与**攻击性的逆转**有关系。如果早年的攻击性无法向外转向，变成攻击自己，则变为抑郁症。
2. **过于强大的超我**，自我不够强大，不能调整超我与本我的冲突，导致恶性自恋。最高级别的自恋就是自杀，攻击完全无法向外。
   - 抑郁症是处于对自我的爱中，是自恋的典型表现。
3. **自我边界不清晰**，没有足够好的防御保护自己，容易使外界的事物进入内心。

**强迫症**的发病机理：

- 首先是攻击性和力比多的压抑。
- 强迫行为是一种隔离的行为，是一种“仪式”行为，用来“隔离情感”。以避免再发生更糟糕的事情。
- 强迫症表现为对自己的不接纳，或者将对自己的不接纳投射出去，变为对他人的不接纳。

【案例】不断洗手的强迫症：

- 洗手代表对自己的道德堕落的不接纳。

**恐怖症**：恐惧是对热爱的掩饰。

- 来访者通常有阻抗或者抵抗，治疗师需要对其的阻抗进行支持。

恐惧与婴儿的强力**控制**：

- 婴儿通过无助，强大地控制了母亲，而且这生死攸关。
- 这些*控制欲会隐藏到没有成长好的人格中*，他需要在社交关系中控制他人，以缓解自己的恐惧。

**玩弄恐惧**：人处在高度恐惧中，但又不被吓死。

- 如吃辣，实际上是在体会婴儿般的无所不能的（控制力）。
- 人类的挑战行为，就是在考验自己的无所不能。

**焦虑症**

- 原始焦虑：担心自身的破碎，_担心自己的边界被突破_，一般处于精神分裂或者人格障碍水平。这来自于几个月大时，幻想自己消失、母亲消失，却没有和母亲建立良好的关系。
- 成熟的焦虑：害怕丧失客体或者客体之爱。神经质性焦虑，是正常的。
- 从这个角度说，完全没有焦虑的、所谓人本主义说自我实现了人，会丧失创造和生活的活力。人不能追求过度的健康。

精神分析关于成长的研究：**哀伤**

- 每一步成长都跟哀伤在一起，成长的力量或能力直接等同于哀伤的能力。这种能力用以解决成长中的步步危机。

**情感**分为两个部分：一个是感受，另外一个是跟这个感受捆绑的认知。

- 抑郁情绪：糟糕的感觉，并认知糟糕的事情*已经*发生。
- 恐惧情绪：糟糕的情绪，并认知糟糕的事情*正在*发生。
- 焦虑情绪：糟糕的感觉，并认知糟糕的事情*将要*发生。
- 无明火：有感觉，无认知
- 高度合理化、情感隔离：无感觉，有认知

不恰当的情绪：

1. 对糟糕情绪的**过度反映**。但糟糕情绪，实际上是对人类的保护，使人类能回避危险。
2. 另外一种是**对情绪的情绪**。对糟糕情绪的接纳本身，就是成长的标志。
   - 许多人失去了哀伤的能力，反倒变成病理性哀伤。如亲人去世，他们感觉不到哀伤，但不断回忆、收集亲人的物件，这就是确定的处在病理性抑郁中间。哀伤的时间过长、过重，即抑郁症，需要做心理治疗干预。
     > 弗洛伊德《哀伤与抑郁》：在我们面临重大丧失的时候，我们不可避免的会哀伤，我们越能够充分的哀伤，我们就越不会得抑郁症。

### 精神分析的心理治疗

疾病是如何产生的？

- 一个人的疾病来自他的力比多和攻击性投注和投注的方向出现问题。比如母亲缺乏、母亲回应不恰当（没有形成良好的客体关系）。此时，孩子的投注会变成物品，变成了恋物癖；或者投注自己，形成病理性自恋。

成年时经历创伤性事件（诱发因素），然后发病。首次发病可以理解为童年创伤的延迟性冲突。

**治疗**：

- 其治疗应为其建立健康的人格。
- 治疗中，来访者不可避免地把早年和父母的关系，转移为和治疗师的关系，即“移情”。**当下关系即是过去关系的重现**。治疗师的任务是，在来访者退行的情况下，回到童年，重新经历一次正确的童年。
  - 这个重构不是在现实中改变与父母的关系，而是重构他内化的的、对他人格有决定性影响的关系。
- 来访者早年在跟父母亲的关系中间，将父母亲内化成自我的一部分，分为两部分：
  - 内在的帮助者（帮助、支持、赞美我）
  - 内在的迫害者（增加许多内心冲突）
- 来访者寻求治疗，也就是在寻找一个能恰当对待其的人。治疗师能恰当对待来访者，就是一种最高级的治疗。
- **退行是一切心理治疗的基础**。没有退行就没有精神分析，也没有一切心理治疗。治疗师需要创造退行的机会和气氛。
- 心理治疗只有一个目的，即增加来访者的“自我”功能，使其能够应对“本我”和“超我”之间的冲突。
- 心理治疗的其中一个功能是使“潜意识意识化”。

### 父母与孩子的冲突

关于学习：

- 正常教育被逼迫学习的时间，是被浪费的、遭受虐待的时间。
- 享受学习的快乐，即在学习中能够享受攻击性和性驱力的满足。

孩子的**两难冲突**：

- 两个成年人的冲突会内化成孩子的内心冲突。
- 观点的冲突从来不会导致伤害。情感和感情的冲突才会。

**评论即限定**：人的一生都是一种**被催眠**的过程，如果小时候就被催眠成乖、顺从的孩子或者不乖、调皮的孩子，他就会向这个方向发展。分析师的任务是像温尼科特一样给孩子**抱持性环境**（holding environment），尽可能的**不被评论**（不被暗示），被评论就是被限定。

- 一个人越是理解自己如何被早年所限定，越不会被早年所限定（背叛即成长）。
- 马斯洛：“我们除了被过去限定之外，还有此时此刻改变自己的雄心壮志。”切断过去，从现在开始，让自己的人格有更大的成长。

【案例】跨性别认同导致肥胖、成绩差、混迹女性社交群体：

- 肥胖既是力比多的压抑，又是攻击性的压抑。
- 成绩差是压抑自己的攻击性，避免自己攻击别人，显示自己在竞争中的一贯失败。
- 只有精神上完全被阉割的人才能正常出入于女孩群体中而没有焦虑。正常的南海因为性的焦虑会有意回避女孩。逃避与男孩玩，也是避免与男孩进行体力和智力的竞争。

### 移情与反移情

**移情**（transference），转移关系，将过去的客体关系转移到当下的关系之中。

- 移情等于对时间的错误。来访者在童年对于一个客体（尤指父母）的情感，在治疗中转移给了治疗师。

**反移情**（couter-transference），是被移情者勾起来（被刺激出）、治疗师所产生的“反应”。

- 治疗师本身会对来访者产生自己的移情，以及反移情两种情感。
- 好的治疗师，就像一面镜子。治疗师把自己的移情部分解决的越多，治疗师反射的部分就越大。

【案例】一些人内心里有无法言说的痛苦，无人能理解。所以他们为了让自己的痛苦能被感知，所以去在人际关系中施加痛苦。（防御机制：投射性认同）

- 退行到早年关系，即相当于婴儿通过让母亲肚子饿，知道自己肚子饿。

治疗师应该帮助来访者：

- 回忆既往生活史；
- 理解在所有处境中的个人反应。

掌握并理解**反移情是治疗的关键**。来访者在治疗中，会将早年形成的关系（通常是父母）潜意识地转移向治疗师，来访者都是以早年的心灵状态与治疗师接触。

- 治疗师判断与来访者交流的心灵深度，可以用时间的深度判断。
- 治疗师先**感受**自己跟病人在一起时的感受，然后再推导导致自己有此感受的病人的病因。治疗师永远要先考虑，在来访者面前是什么感觉？有什么想法？做了什么所谓错误的事情？
  > 利用反移情：我不管你是谁，我首先管我在你面前我是谁。我通过在你面前我是谁的这种感觉，我就知道了你是谁。

反移情有两种：互补性，一致性。

- 互补性：治疗师跟病人的关系中，治疗师感受到病人的原始客体（父母）对病人的感受，并向病人的原始客体一样的不恰当的对待病人。此时需要寻找一致性反移情。
- 一致性：理解（代入）移情者的处境，共情了。

对于反移情的处理。治疗师应该：

- 对自己的心理发展及生活事件保持清醒的头脑；
- 不要把来访者的感情往自己身上揽；
- 不要让反移情见诸行动；
- 运用反移情帮助解释；
- 运用反移情愤怒理解病人的敌意；
- 检查自己的情感反应，作为了解来访者动力学的线索；
- 当体验到互补性的反移情时，要寻找一致性的反移情。

心理治疗的四个过程：

1. 小时候曾经被不恰当对待，形成有问题的人格；
2. 试图改变，找心理医生，希望被恰当对待；
3. 在治疗关系中，潜意识会**诱导**心理医生像自己的父母或者其他人一样不恰当的对待自己；（移情）
4. 心理医生要顶住被诱导出不恰当地对待病人的压力，坚决不要不恰当地对待病人。（处理反移情）

**理智是对情感的防御**：

- 内心情感过于丰富的人，因其害怕这类情感，所以会倾向于非常遵从理智。

### 口欲期、肛欲期、俄狄浦斯期

精神分析角度的心理疾病，都是**发育的疾病**。没有充分长大，就会产生心理问题。

弗洛伊德划分的**三个成长阶段**：
1. **口欲期**（0-18个月）：通过嘴唇接触外物。获得快感、建立关系的部位。
   * 三种进食障碍：神经性厌食症；神经性贪食症；神经性暴食症。
   * 口欲期的滞留现象：抽烟、用说话虐待他人。
2. **肛欲期**（18-36个月）：**控制**大小便的任务。这关系到自己对身体的感觉、荣誉、跟妈妈的联系。
   * 与母亲的关系，即大小便的决定权，这是一种权力斗争。之后几十年的权力斗争的模型，都与此有关。
   * 父母过度控制孩子的大小便，会使得孩子：过度控制自己；完全不控制自己。
   * 如果和人打交道时，必须按照他的习惯，否则，要么我会内疚，要么我需要费很大劲才能反抗控制。这就表示此人有可能心理发展处在肛欲期。
3. **俄狄浦斯期**：
   * 神经症水平的人主要是俄狄浦斯冲突。
   * 俄狄浦斯情节是经典精神分析的核心问题，讨论的是父母子三人之间的关系。

【案例】唱歌难听被杀事件
* 唱歌难听，激起了杀人者因为自身不完美产生的羞耻感。为了否认羞耻感的存在、自身缺憾的存在，因此住下大厝（监狱够大吧）。
* 杀人者人格不独立、边界不清，把别人的问题看成是自己的问题进行攻击。

若某人**用语言使人不适**：
* 语言空洞无物，用来**虐待**别人，让人不舒服：口欲期问题。
* 用语言用来**控制**他人：肛欲期问题。
* 用语言做充分的**表达**：俄狄浦斯期问题。

传递内心感受的三种方式：
1. 用语言告诉他人，心里很痛苦；
2. 只能通过行为，让他人知道有多痛苦；
3. 让他人同样难受的方式来表达痛苦。即：如果一个人无法用语言去表达自己的痛苦，那么有可能会给周围人制造痛苦，以达到表达痛苦的目的。（佩恩行为：一大米偶扛几楼）

**边界**：
* 我们的边界不断被突破的时候，我们就把自己的一部分给了别人。
* 逆反心理是对边界被突破的反抗。
* 一个人的好多毛病是为了配合别人而产生的，相当于开了一个自我功能的口子，让他人畅通无阻地进入。
* 固着在**前俄狄浦斯期**的人，其自我是和谐的，而和外界不和谐，外界的人好像无法干扰他。

**自我管理**：成熟的人应该可以自我管理。如果自我管理的部分被骚扰、被他人替代，当无人干预时，就会出现问题。

**依赖**、**控制**与口欲期：
* 健康的人应该可以独立生活。如果一个人过分依赖其他人，不依赖就无法活下去，就是口欲期出现了问题。
* 人应该知道自己有能力让别人帮忙。
* 依赖从来源、功效来说，其**目的都是控制**。
* 让人理解到自己原来还残留婴儿般的、通过依赖控制他人的愿望时，其心理人格就长大了一点。此即谓“潜意识意识化”。

温尼科特：过渡性客体
* 如果不能控制母亲，也不能控制自己，至少可以控制一个中间物，如玩具熊。

【案例】境虎崇尚过度管理的就是文化处在肛欲期的表现。

三种**俄狄浦斯冲突**：生和死，男和女，成功和惩罚。

成功和成功的惩罚：
* 如发了横财之后，会恐惧并等待某种惩罚（潜意识认为：惩罚会紧接着成功到来 ⇒ 于是避免成功 or 成功之后自我攻击）。
* 因为害怕等待着的惩罚，所以不使自己过度成功。
* 若父母对孩子有过于严厉的要求时，孩子就会感到：只要自己舒服了，就会有惩罚。

【案例】考试焦虑症（成功与惩罚）：
* 一个人意识到自己非常希望考好，但潜意识里又害怕巨大成功之后等待着的惩罚，就会发展出紧张症状，让自己考得不要太好。
* 这是典型的俄狄浦斯冲突。

科胡特：“**父母是什么人，比父母是什么更重要**。”
* 健康父母的人格是超越了依赖和独立（口欲期）的问题，界于需要控制就控制，不需要控制就不控制（肛欲期）的灵活状态。

让孩子形成健康人格的建议：
1. 父母需要足够强大，让孩子尽可能生活在父母三角形内，由父母决定大事。
2. 在孩子的教育中“留白”，不能总锁在家长中间，而是需要和自己、和外人玩。否则，没有新的客体经验，精神世界的规模变小。

避免让孩子陷入严重的俄狄浦斯冲突：
* 父母给孩子抱持性的环境，让孩子的攻击性和力比多不断的象征化；即使取得更高级的成功，也不会有惩罚，让孩子知道他配得上享受所有成功的快乐。
* 孩子在潜意识中不愿超越自己的父母，也是一种俄狄浦斯冲突（避免被惩罚）。这种冲突会代际流传。心理治疗的干预，并非干预单独的人，也在干预家族链。

创造力的形成：当与母亲关系出问题时，孩子需要想象和创造去弥补关系的不足。

在生活中，如果人们如果遇到一个足够强大的人，他可以起到心理咨询师的作用，可以替代曾经被内化了的母亲的样子。

### 性与死亡

女性遭受性快感缺失、强度不够、高峰体验年龄大（35岁）：
* 潜意识认为，没有独立使用身体享受的权力，以此来忠诚母亲。
* 认为自己是未成年人，属于父母。
* 这可能和文化的关系最大，文化压抑。

俄狄浦斯冲突在性上的表现为：如果满足与性有关的事情时，就对同性的父母有攻击，但不满足对自我有攻击。

性与死亡紧密相连。性代表生命的降临，生命都面临死亡。
* 对死亡的恐惧：不是因为自己消失了，而是因为周围的人不见了。（婴儿般的恐惧）
* 突破父母的禁忌，则意味着父母的死亡（消失不见）。
* 按照客体关系理论，活着的目标就是**寻求客体的回应**。如果没有回应，则意味着自己的消失（死亡）。每个人都倾向于让别人知晓自己的内心所想、处于什么状况。这会给人一种正在活着、富有价值的感受。

不同阶段的**死亡焦虑**：
1. 口欲期：咬乳头，认为会被母亲抛弃（攻击性释放后的惩罚）。
2. 肛欲期：不能控制母亲就会死亡。
3. 俄狄浦斯期：如果有与性有关的活动，就会死亡。

【案例】对视恐怖（俄狄浦斯冲突）：
* 害怕自己的眼睛冲突的自己。
* 害怕自己的边界被突破。

【案例】余光恐怖：
* 害怕其他人的余光穿透自己。
* 这表示周围有很多威胁，与其母亲经常职责、挑剔（攻击性）他有关。 


### 梦的解析

关于梦：
* 梦是维持人类心理、生理健康的重要过程。
* 弗洛伊德：梦是愿望的达成。
* 比昂：梦整合破碎的心理功能。只有一个人的人格健康到一定程度，才能面对做梦时，体会到自我功能的完整性。

弗洛伊德：“梦是通往**潜意识的捷径**。”
* 潜意识：1. 口误；2. 自由联想；3. 

梦分为三个部分：
1. **显梦**：醒后被记忆、可以被讲述的部分
2. **隐梦**：隐藏在显梦之后潜意识冲突，可能非常庞大
3. **梦的工作**：凝缩、象征、再度校正、转移、特殊表现力（连结显梦和隐梦）

梦的五种工作模式：
1. 凝缩：显梦是隐梦的浓缩版。
2. 象征：不仅指潜隐内容，而且可以被理解为对潜隐内容的翻译。
3. 再度校正：服务于显梦的连贯组合。
4. 转移：人物的置换。
5. 特殊表现力：潜意识冲突视觉化。

释梦的三个步骤：
1. 梦里的情绪；
2. 把梦和现实的冲突联系起来；
3. 把梦和人格联系起来。

> 并不是所有的梦都有意义。

> 荣格：共时性，事与事之间的非因果性联系。

【案例】肮脏的梦：
* 可能与意识、潜意识的区别太大有关系。
* 也可能在客体关系的远近上有关系，与某人关系过近，有道德上肮脏、自我边界被突破的焦虑，同时又希望变得独立。
* 可能涉及到施虐、受虐，梦中客体转移成了自己，将施虐的欲望转到自己身上。

弗洛伊德后梦的精神分析理论的发展：
* 显梦变得越来越重要；
* 梦被认为是具有多种躯体功能的多功能的创造；
* 自我和超我的规则变得更加重要；
* 客体关系论日益重要。

梦的功能：愿望实现；记忆固结；问题解决；减少应激；创造力；冲突解决；情绪调节。

人为的过分强调文化间或种族间的差异是一种疾病，是为了制造冲突找借口。

【案例】考试焦虑的梦：
* 这是不让自己充分释放攻击性和力比多。
* 超我太强的人，或者这两个驱力被极度压抑的人，就不会过于顺畅地释放驱力。因为过度释放驱力会产生道德上的内疚感。
* 治疗：使其不要过于压抑力比多和攻击性的释放。

【案例】爬（无尽的）楼梯的梦：
* 也与攻击性和力比多的压抑有关。
* 爬楼梯与性快感不断累积、最后释放相似。不断爬楼梯可能与不敢使自己尽情享受性活动有关。
* 爬楼梯可能意味着占据高处，更容易攻击别人、免受他人攻击。如果不敢去高处，则是担忧自己过于攻击别人、或者担心攻击转向自己。

**精神分裂病人不作梦**，梦可能导致分裂的自我拼凑成为整体，这不是精神分裂的患者能够忍耐、承受、容纳的。所以没有把梦呈现给自己的能力或者勇气。

梦的组成部分：
1. 力比多。
2. 日常生活的碎片。
3. 梦的稽查员，即我们需要按照自己的道德、美学等观点对梦进行加工。

咨询师听来访者**讲述梦**的五个步骤：
1. 完整描述梦的具体过程；
2. 就梦的情景和人物自由联想；
3. 纯粹的谈论现实冲突；
4. 了解原生家庭及来访者人格；
5. 使来访者谈未来的生活和理想。

【案例】极度危险的情境的梦：
* 有可能在早期，与原始客体的连接有一部分高度隔离、扭曲、难受的体验。这种体验在成年时复现。

【案例】性梦
* 巨大男性生殖器：有可能是遭遇挫败感后的自我满足

【案例】噩梦
* 像清醒时创伤的强迫性重复。

【案例】亲人去世
* 去世=攻击，对父母的攻击意味着渴望独立。

【案例】牙齿脱落
* 牙齿象征攻击，强烈释放攻击性后，产生了内疚感。

【案例】梦见软体虫
* 矛盾：在亲密关系中间既想靠近，又恐惧靠近后造成伤害。也意味着控制。

【案例】开车、开飞机、骑车的梦
* 亲密关系的控制。化被动为主动。

【案例】被蚂蟥等叮咬
* 早年亲密关系中与客体关系边界不清、被语言虐待。被过度干扰、指责。

### 母婴关系

客体关系理论学派对于儿童治疗的分歧：
1. 安娜·弗洛伊德：儿童自我功能很弱，在对其做精神分析治疗时，需要有更多的教育引导。
2. 梅兰妮·克莱因：儿童自我功能不弱，甚至比成人更强。儿童和成人无须分别。

温尼科特对于母婴关系的独特视角：
* 她关注的不再是母或子单独的状体，而是母子之间的**关系和相互作用**时如何**促进或阻碍**孩子发展的。
* 这也催生了自体心理学。

假性自体和真性自体：
1. 假性自体：仿佛是真性自体的外壳。来源于：早年生活充满危险，需要保护自己的防御。
2. 真性自体：早年时，如果母亲能细腻地感受孩子的感受，并提供及时的需要，孩子的真性自体就可以健康成长。否则，忽略婴儿或者处于产后抑郁症时，忽略了婴儿丰富的幻想，那么就可能使其无法形成心理上的自体，人格出于破碎状态。

温尼科特：母亲恨孩子的十七条原因。
* 甫出生时，孩子与其想像不同。
* 婴儿不是童年的游戏、不是父亲、兄弟的孩子。
* 生育子女的过程不够浪漫、梦幻、美好（不具备神话色彩）。
* 婴儿对母亲生活干扰。
* 生孩子并非出自的意愿，而来源于母亲、丈夫家族。
* 婴儿伤害母亲。
* 婴儿对母亲的无情态度，让母亲觉得自己是被使用。
* 婴儿的排泄物。
* 婴儿对母亲的幻想破灭。
* 婴儿得到想要的东西后就不顾母亲。
* 养育婴儿支配了生活方式。
* 婴儿不知道母亲的奉献和牺牲。
* 拒绝来自母亲的食物、怀疑母亲。
* 婴儿向陌生人微笑。
* 母亲知道如果自己抛弃婴儿，婴儿则会报复她。
* 婴儿使母亲兴奋并挫败，不能食用婴儿或者性交。

母亲觉察到对孩子的恨的现实意义：
* 为了使孩子能够健康成长。如果母亲只能察觉到对孩子的爱，而拒绝承认有恨存在，那么她可能把孩子“吞噬”（用自己的主体性侵占孩子的主体性？高度控制？将爱作为结构合理化一系列的离谱有害行为？），在孩子面前为所欲为，使孩子患严重的精神疾病。

一个好的母亲，与其说是知道对孩子做什么，不如说知道对孩子不做什么。

**过渡性客体**：主体和客体的中间地带。
* 第一个过渡性客体是婴儿的大拇指。
* 孩子需要对过渡性客体有**绝对的控制权**。自己能够完全控制某部分东西的能力，对婴儿的人格发展具有重要意义。
* 当婴儿能控制自己、大小便时，就不再需要过渡性客体。

【案例】恋爱中100%控制对方的欲望，就是享受退行到早年时候的乐趣。时间长了会导致冲突。

**60分妈妈**（Good enough mother）：
* 糟糕的妈妈：婴儿感受到了最大的恐惧和绝望时仍没有出现。
* 完美的妈妈：让婴儿丧失体验恐惧和焦虑的机会。当妈妈要求自己完美时，就会把不完美投射给孩子，使其焦虑。
* 60分妈妈：让婴儿体验安全和危险，但不致于绝望。这使得孩子的人格中有强大的信念和力量，认为陷入绝境中有人会帮助。这能防止孩子有精神疾病，促进人格健康成长。

温尼科特的建议：在孩子恨母亲之前，母亲须先推开孩子，避免“共生”。

恰到好处的挫折：按时间划定。在承受挫折的范围内，挫折使人成长。

母婴间隙：
* 母婴间隙可以增加孩子的创造力。
* 前提条件：父母与孩子之间的信任体验。如果对孩子不信任，则会过度监视、管控孩子。

人本主义心理学认为：我们需要相信，每一个人，在没有外力强制的情况下，会倾向于被主流社会所认可。

生命不应该被他人规划：人应该自然地出生、自然的成长。人不应该为了满足自己的愿望，规划一个刚出生的婴儿的生命，这是反人性的。

温尼科特的五个治疗要点：
1. 拥有耐心。
2. 与来访者有专业化的设置。让来访者感受到
3. 安全的便于退行的环境。
4. 允许病人表达情感创伤。抱持性环境去处理病人的羞耻感。
5. 重建病人的无所不能感。

## 弗洛伊德 [1856-1939]

> 西格蒙德·弗洛伊德（Sigmund Freud），奥地利精神病医师、心理学家、精神分析学派创始人。他开创了潜意识研究的新领域，促进了动力心理学、人格心理学和变态心理学的发展，奠定了现代医学模式的新基础，为20世纪西方人文学科提供了重要理论支柱。

## 荣格 [1875-1961]

> 卡尔·荣格（Carl Gustav Jung），瑞士心理学家。1907年开始与西格蒙德·弗洛伊德合作，发展及推广精神分析学说长达6年之久，之后与弗洛伊德理念不和，分道扬镳，创立了荣格人格分析心理学理论，提出“情结“的概念，把人格分为内倾和外倾两种，主张把人格分为意识、个人无意识和集体无意识三层。

人格理论三大核心问题：
1. 人格结构问题：组成要素；以及要素之间、与外界如何相互作用。
2. 人格动力问题：激发人格的能量来源；能量在要素之间的分配。
3. 人格发展问题：人格的产生和生命过程中的变化。

概念不是无害的（荣格版）：概念可能偏误或限制我们的观察，使我们对那些根本不存在的东西误以为真，而对那些确实存在的东西则视而不见。

荣格基本思想：
1. 精神（psyche）：人从一开始就是整体，不是通过经验和学习逐步获得（反对拼凑的人格理论）。
   *  荣格认为精神分为三个层次：意识、个人无意识、集体无意识。
2. 意识：人心中唯一能够被自己知道的部分。
   * 荣格将其分为：思维、情感、感觉、直觉四种心理功能。儿童会优先使用其中一个功能。
   * 两种心态：内倾（意识定向于内部主观世界）；外倾（意识定向于外部客观世界）。
   * 个性化（individuation）：意识的拓展。个性化和意识在人格的发展中时同步的。
   * 自我（ego）：荣格用“自我”来命名自觉意识的组织。
3. 个人无意识：



儿童幻想、阻碍、力比多退行：
* 每个儿童都会有欲望（荣格的力比多指所有种类的欲念）受阻的时候，一般都是由于父母阻止其行为导致的。此时儿童力比多会退行到更年幼时，使用幻想来填满受阻的力比多。
* 如果儿童力比多受阻过多，幻想可能越来越真实，成为无法辨别真伪的记忆。成年后会无法面对现实，一味逃避、搁置现实。想做的事、想实现的需求一旦遇到阻碍，就会陷入“力比多退行”，开始调用儿童时期的“幻想”宽慰、变向满足自己，进而引发更严重的心理问题。
* 心理症状严重者，会在咨询过程中遇到防御性问题时“力比多退行”，熟练地假想出一段记忆来。
* 精神分裂者则更为严重，能产生无比真实的幻视和幻听。
* 因神经官能症（抑郁症、焦虑症、强迫症）而产生生理症状时，也是使用幻想，搁置现实问题。荣格：“那期间就是，他还活在一个幻想的世界里，在这个世界里，只能形容为儿童心智的样子，心理症状的人总会自动化地出现幼稚的偏见、错觉和莫名其妙的要求。”

## 拉康 [1901-1981]

> 雅克·拉康（Jacques Lacan），法国作家、学者、精神分析学家，也被认为是结构主义者。拉康从语言学出发来重新解释弗洛依德的学说，他提出的诸如镜像阶段论（mirror phase）等学说对当代理论有重大影响，被称为自笛卡尔以来法国最为重要的哲人，在欧洲他也被称为自尼采和弗洛伊德以来最有创意和影响的思想家。
