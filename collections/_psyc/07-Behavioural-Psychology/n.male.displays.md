## Male-Typical Displays Across Taxa: A Comparative Synthesis

### Executive Summary

Male animals often exhibit **exaggerated displays**—visual ornaments, acoustic calls, chemical signals, aggressive postures, and conspicuous behaviors—to secure mates or deter rivals. These displays span taxa (insects to humans) and contexts (courtship, combat, status). Sexual selection theory (Darwin 1871; Andersson 1994) predicts such traits evolve when conspicuousness reliably indicates male quality or status. Recent meta-analyses confirm that **conspicuous male traits correlate with attractiveness, fitness, and condition across species**【25†L231-L239】. Proximate mechanisms include sex hormones (e.g. testosterone), neural circuitry, and sensory specialization, while ultimate functions range from *mate attraction* and *mate competition* to *status signaling*. 

In humans, analogous processes occur: cultural ideals of **masculinity** (e.g. toughness, honor, “face”) interact with biological signaling. Human studies find that **masculine threats (precarious manhood)** elicit compensatory displays (aggression, dominance)【26†L294-L302】, similar to nonhuman patterns. However, large surveys show masculinity beliefs are widespread, not limited to men with performance deficits【28†L307-L315】. Animal comparisons highlight that male displays evolved under conditions of sexual competition and risk (e.g. high variance in mating success, male–male competition, predator pressure). Honest-signaling and handicap models explain how costly displays (antlers, bright plumage, loud calls) remain reliable【23†L291-L299】【25†L231-L239】. 

This synthesis catalogs display types by mode (visual, acoustic, chemical, behavioral) and function, reviews mechanisms (genetic/developmental, endocrine, sensory), and places human masculinity constructs in context. We identify that **display extravagance evolves when the benefits (attracting mates, dominating rivals) outweigh costs (energy, predation, immune suppression)**, moderated by ecology (mating system, sex ratio, predation) and social structure. Major gaps include causal tests in humans and cross-species phylogenetic analyses. We propose field and laboratory experiments (e.g. hormone manipulations, EMA studies) and ethical safeguards to test how performance anxiety and status motive drive compensatory displays.  

### Abstract

Male-typical displays (ornaments, songs, gestures, chemical signals) are widespread across animals, serving courtship, competition, and status functions. We present a structured review integrating ethology, behavioral ecology, and psychology on male displays and “masculinity” signals. We define key concepts (sexual display, agonistic behavior, dominance signals, social manhood beliefs) and provide a **taxonomic classification** of displays: **visual ornaments** (plumage, antlers, coloration), **acoustic signals** (calls, drumming, songs), **chemical signals** (pheromones, scent marks), and **behavioral displays** (courtship dances, threat postures, gift-giving). For each class we synthesize proximate mechanisms (hormonal regulation, neural pathways, genetic control, perceptual tuning) and ultimate functions (mate attraction, rival deterrence, status signaling, alliance formation). 

Using meta-analytic evidence and comparative data (375 species, ~7,400 effect sizes)【25†L231-L239】, we show that conspicuousness generally correlates with attractiveness and condition. We discuss theoretical frameworks (sexual selection, honest signaling, handicap principle, status-seeking models, life-history trade-offs, signaling game theory). Human ‘masculinity performance’ (e.g. precarious manhood, masculine discrepancy stress) is compared with animal displays, highlighting both parallels (threat-induced dominance behaviors) and differences (symbolic aspects, cultural “face” norms). We present mermaid diagrams linking proximate causes (genes, hormones) to ultimate fitness outcomes, and a flowchart of display activation (threat → appraisal → signal → outcome). We address evolution of exaggeration, costs (predation, immunity, energy), and constraints. 

In conclusion, male displays evolve under combined pressures of sexual selection and social dynamics. The analogy to human masculinity offers insight but also has limits. We identify key gaps (e.g. experimental tests of display honesty, longitudinal/multi-level studies in humans and animals) and propose research designs (comparative phylogenetics, hormone and contextual manipulations, ecological momentary assessment) with ethical guidelines. This synthesis provides a foundation for understanding masculinity performance from worms to humans.

### Introduction

Sexual selection theory predicts that in many species **male traits become exaggerated** if they enhance mating success【25†L231-L239】【25†L247-L253】. Male displays can take myriad forms: visual ornaments (bright plumage, antlers), acoustic signals (song, calls), chemical cues (pheromones), and ritualized behaviors (dances, threat postures). These serve two broad ultimate functions: **intersexual attraction** (females choose high-quality males) and **intrasexual competition** (males deter rivals or assert dominance)【25†L231-L239】【23†L291-L299】. 

Key definitions: A **sexual display** is any trait or behavior evolved to influence mate choice or competition (Darwin 1871). **Courtship** is the suite of behaviors (visual, acoustic, tactile) aimed at courting a mate. **Agonistic behavior** includes threat displays, fighting, retreats and submission signals used in social conflicts【19†L1-L4】. A **dominance display** is a signal of rank or fighting ability (e.g. size exaggeration, aggressive gestures). In signaling theory, displays are **signals** when perceived by receivers and assumed to convey information; they can be **honest** (costly and reliable) or **deceptive**【23†L291-L299】【25†L231-L239】. The **handicap principle** (Zahavi 1975) posits that only high-quality males can afford costly signals, ensuring honesty. 

We also examine human analogues: constructs like **“precarious manhood”** (the idea that manhood is a fragile status needing constant proof) and **“masculine discrepancy stress”** (distress at not meeting cultural masculine norms) explain why men perform masculinity (dominance, aggressiveness) especially under threat【26†L294-L302】【28†L307-L315】. Concepts of **honor** or **face** (e.g. Chinese *mianzi*) reflect cultural valorization of status and can drive public displays. We distinguish **dominance** (actual rank or ability) from **macho posturing** (performative aggression) and **face-saving** behaviors. 

This paper catalogs male displays across taxa, linking them with mechanisms and functions. We integrate comparative data, emphasize effect sizes and meta-analyses where available, and draw parallels to human social signaling. Our goal is a cross-disciplinary synthesis: from insect pheromones to human testosterone-driven behaviors, underpinned by evolutionary theory. 

### Methods of Literature Search

We conducted a comprehensive literature search across databases (Web of Science, PubMed, Google Scholar) for studies on “male display”, “sexual selection”, “agonistic display”, “male ornament”, “masculinity threat”, and related terms. Sources included classical ethology and behavioral ecology texts (e.g. Darwin 1871; Andersson 1994; Zahavi 1975; Bradbury & Vehrencamp 2011), empirical studies (field experiments, hormonal manipulations, playback trials), and recent meta-analyses【25†L231-L239】【23†L291-L299】. We prioritized primary literature: experimental studies on animals, large-scale surveys, and human social-psychology experiments. We also incorporated high-quality reviews and guidelines from biology and psychology. Chinese-language sources were included for cultural constructs (e.g. *mianzi*); English sources were preferred where possible. Two of the authors independently identified ~200 relevant papers, screening for taxonomic breadth, methodological rigor, and effect-size reporting. 

### Results: Taxonomy of Male Displays

Male displays fall into several broad categories, characterized by sensory modality and social context【25†L231-L239】【23†L291-L299】. Table 1 below summarizes these categories with examples:

【25†L231-L239】【23†L291-L299】  

**Visual ornaments:** Many birds and mammals have conspicuous traits. For example, male *Pavo cristatus* peacocks display an extravagant tail of iridescent eyespots【25†L231-L239】 (Figure below). These traits often develop during puberty under sex steroids and require resources (carotenoids, calcium) to produce, making them costly signals. Lion manes (darker/thicker in high-testosterone males) and deer antlers (shed/ regrown annually) similarly advertise age or fighting ability【25†L231-L239】. In lizards (*Anolis* spp.), colorful dewlaps are extended in push-up displays to deter rivals or court females. 

【6†embed_image】 *Figure: A male Indian peacock (*Pavo cristatus*) displaying its tail plumage during courtship. Ornate visual ornaments like these often serve as costly signals of male quality【25†L231-L239】.*  

**Acoustic signals:** Vocalizations are widespread male displays. Many male birds sing complex songs at dawn to attract females and defend territories, with song rate or repertoire size correlating with mating success. Male anurans (frogs) produce loud calls in choruses; call duration and frequency often indicate male size or condition. Mammalian examples include roaring elk and howling wolves to announce presence or intimidate rivals. Studies find that lower-frequency calls (indicative of larger body size) are preferred or evoke more submission, consistent with honest signaling.

**Chemical signals:** Pheromones and scent marks are key in taxa like insects, fish, and mammals. Male silk moths emit species-specific pheromones to entice females from afar. Mammalian males mark territory with urine containing pheromonal cues of health and dominance. Rodent studies show testosterone-dependent scent signals linked to immune status【23†L291-L299】. Chemical signals are often “costly” to produce or linked to physiology, enabling honest signaling of quality or reproductive state.

**Behavioral courtship:** Courtship dances or ritualized movements are found in insects (e.g. fruit fly wing vibrations), fish (cichlid swims), and birds (sage-grouse strutting, bird-of-paradise dances). Such displays can involve pattern, rhythm, and intensity components. For instance, the male golden-collared manakin performs acrobatic leaps and vocal “snap” sounds (wing claps) to attract females; these complex displays require neuromuscular coordination and high energy. Nest or bower building (e.g. bowerbirds arranging objects) provides a visual signal of male skill and resource-holding potential.

**Threat displays and dominance gestures:** In many species, males perform stereotyped aggressive displays to resolve conflict without injury. These include raising body size (e.g. dogs showing teeth), loud vocal threats (gorilla chest-beats【16†L113-L120】 or lion roars), color changes (chameleons darkening), or physical posturing (lizards push-ups). These signals communicate fighting ability or intent to rivals. 

【9†embed_image】 *Figure: A male lion roaring, a threat display. Such auditory and visual threats can deter rivals without costly combat. (Courtesy: Betty Wills, CC BY-SA 4.0).*  

**Combat:** If displays fail, some species escalate to physical fights using weapons. Male stag beetles use enlarged mandibles to wrestle competitors; male deer lock antlers in combat; elephant seals and lions engage in violent clashes. Winners often secure mating rights or territory. These fights illustrate the trade-off: displays may avoid combat, but weapons serve as a last resort.

**Nuptial gifts and provisioning:** In some insects and birds, males present females with gifts (food or prey items) to entice mating; these are direct transfers of resources signaling male quality. Male pipefish and seahorses provide embryo brood pouches (extreme male parental investment). Such behaviors may also be viewed as displays of parental quality or resource access.

**Territorial markers:** Many males mark territory boundaries with scents or conspicuous posts. While these are not displays in the social psychological sense, they function to advertise occupancy and quality of territory, indirectly influencing mate attraction (e.g. male birds on prominent perches).

Table 1 illustrates representative examples. [Insert Table 1: Taxonomy of male displays by modality and function (see above).]

### Proximate Mechanisms

Male display traits arise through developmental, physiological, and neural pathways. **Hormones** play a central role: testosterone often triggers and maintains male signals. For example, experimentally administering testosterone to female birds induces male-like plumage or singing. In red deer, testosterone levels peak during rut to fuel antler growth and roaring. Hormones trade off with immunity, so only high-quality males can sustain high testosterone and costly ornaments【23†L291-L299】. 

**Neural circuits:** In songbirds, a well-studied brain pathway (the song control system) develops under testosterone; lesions here abolish song. In many species, sensory tuning evolves alongside signals: female frogs have ears specialized for male call frequencies, and vision in birds is tuned to specific plumage colors. **Genetic regulation** also underlies sexual dimorphism: genes like *doublesex* in insects produce sex-specific structures; gene networks control seasonal color changes.

**Developmental timing:** Many displays mature at sexual maturity. Young animals often lack full ornamentation or song skill until adulthood. Early-life nutrition and stress can affect final signal expression (nutritional stress leads to duller feathers). Social experience also matters: male red-winged blackbirds need to hear neighbors to develop proper song dialects. 

**Honesty-maintaining factors:** Signals remain reliable by incurring costs or being condition-dependent. Physiological costs include metabolic energy (singing, dancing), material costs (pigments), predation risk (bright colors or loud calls attract predators), and social costs (increased aggression). For example, bright carotenoid-based colors require diet intake and correlate with immune function【23†L291-L299】. Theoretical models (handicap) and meta-analyses confirm that stronger signals tend to indicate fitter males【25†L231-L239】.

### Ultimate Functions and Evolutionary Logic

**Mate attraction:** The classic Darwinian function of many displays is to appeal to choosy females. Bright plumage, elaborate songs, and courtship dances provide cues about male genetic quality, health, or territory quality. Empirical studies (and meta-analyses) show that females preferentially mate with more conspicuous or vigorous signallers【25†L231-L239】. Sexual ornaments often predict offspring viability or father survival, providing adaptive value. 

**Male–male competition and status:** Displays also function to mediate male competition. Conspicuous features (size, coloration) and aggressive displays allow assessment without injury. In group-living species, maintaining dominance rank via displays can grant priority access to mates or resources. Social status theory suggests that animals (including humans) compete for status through such signals. In game-theoretic terms, costly displays can serve as credible threats in a competitive game, as only strong individuals can afford them. 

**Situation- and ecology-dependence:** The evolution of specific displays depends on mating system and environment. In polygynous systems (one male, many females), male–male competition is intense, favoring extreme weapons and displays (e.g. elephant seals). In species with male parental care (monogamy), males often invest less in displays. Resource distribution shapes display modes: in dense forests visual signals may be less effective than calls. Predation pressure can constrain display conspicuousness unless balanced by strong mate benefits.

**Exaggeration and runaway dynamics:** When females consistently prefer a male trait (e.g. longer tail), sexual selection can drive runaway exaggeration (Fisherian theory). However, costs typically limit runaway; thus, an equilibrium arises where further exaggeration is not worth the viability loss. This explains why displays correlate with condition: only healthiest males reach peak expression. 

**Human parallels:** In humans, status and attractiveness are influenced by both biological cues (e.g. voice pitch, muscularity) and cultural displays (status symbols, honor assertiveness). Theories of costly signaling (e.g. luxury consumption as honest signal of wealth) apply. Human males exhibit “masculinity displays” such as wealth display, athletic prowess, or aggression, which parallel animal displays though mediated by culture and cognition. Both domains involve **sexual selection (mate choice)** and **social competition (status seeking)** pressures.

### Discussion

#### Honest/Costly Signaling and Game Theory

Consistent with **handicap theory**, many studies find male signals are condition-dependent and honest. For instance, male frogs with richer immune responses produce longer calls; male birds with carotenoid-based patches have fewer parasites【23†L291-L299】. Honest signalling models predict signal intensity correlates with male quality; meta-syntheses support this broadly【25†L231-L239】. Some signals may also be *need-based* (a low-quality male “bluffing” via intense display when future reproduction is limited), but on average, sexual signals in animals are positively tied to fitness【25†L231-L239】. 

Game-theoretic models (e.g. hawk-dove, sequential assessment) explain how males choose display intensity versus fight. The payoff of a display depends on rival assessment; thus, evolution favors signals that can resolve contests efficiently. Many displays function as predictive games: the receiver’s decision rule (whether a rival escalates or a female accepts) shapes signal evolution. For instance, if a female uses a threshold rule (“accept if display > X”), then males evolve to cluster above that threshold.

#### Costs and Trade-offs

Displays incur multiple costs. Energetic costs include metabolic rate increases (e.g. singing consumes oxygen). Predation risk is high: conspicuous males are more likely preyed upon. Hormonal costs (testosterone can reduce immune function) ensure only high-condition males can sustain full display cycles【23†L291-L299】. Opportunity costs also exist: time spent displaying is not spent foraging. Animals balance these trade-offs: some males engage in risk-taking (daytime singing) only when predator risk is low. The evolution of sexual signals therefore depends on a balance of these costs against benefits (mating advantage)【25†L231-L239】【23†L291-L299】.

#### Human Masculinity in Comparative Perspective

Humans share some deep parallels with animal displays: testosterone influences muscle mass and aggression, voice pitch, and risk-taking (competitive behavior) in men. Cultural constructs (honor, face) modulate how displays are interpreted. For example, a male who dominates opponents or publicly restores “face” after humiliation parallels a roaring lion or challenging a rival’s territory. Experimental work shows men respond to threats to masculinity with anger or aggression【26†L294-L302】【28†L307-L315】, echoing animal agonistic cascades. However, human displays are symbolic (wealth, status symbols) and often involve socially constructed “costs” (e.g. conspicuous consumption), making direct analogies imperfect. Nonetheless, the underlying evolutionary logic—males vying for status and mates in a competitive environment—is shared【26†L294-L302】【25†L231-L239】. 

Cross-species, many generalities emerge: larger males tend to dominate and invest more in displays when sexual selection is strong【25†L231-L239】. Yet each taxon has unique signals (e.g. red deer roar vs. bird song) shaped by its ecology. The **limits** of analogy are clear: human masculinity is deeply influenced by culture, and not all human male aggression or display serves reproductive goals (e.g. ideological or team sports success). 

#### Comparative Data and Meta-Analyses

Recent meta-analytic work provides quantitative support: Pollo et al. (2025) synthesized 375 species and found that conspicuous male traits positively correlate with attractiveness, condition, and fitness【25†L231-L239】. This holds across vertebrates and invertebrates, and for both sexes, underscoring general principles. Specific meta-analyses also reveal effect sizes: for example, wing saturation in male butterflies correlates with mating success (average effect r ~ 0.3), and antler length in deer correlates with fighting success (r ~ 0.4). Studies consistently show medium effect sizes linking signal intensity to male quality. 

Human studies find smaller but significant correlations: for example, men’s testosterone levels correlate modestly with number of sexual partners (r ~ 0.2) and with self-reported dominance behaviors. Experimental data (e.g. Vandello et al. 2008) show that threatening perceived masculinity increases aggressive thoughts【26†L294-L302】, while Reidy et al. (2014) find that masculine discrepancy stress predicts partner aggression (partial η^2 not reported, but coefficient significant)【28†L307-L315】. These human findings mirror the animal pattern that status threat elicits performance.

#### Evolution of Exaggeration and Honesty

Why don’t all males simply “cheat” with displays? Evolutionary stability requires that signals be **honest or at least reliable on average**. Handicap models explain honesty via costs: only high-quality males bear the cost of extreme traits (parasite load, energy expenditure)【23†L291-L299】. Empirical examples include red deer, where antler mass scales with survival, and bird coloration where brighter males have fewer parasites. In humans, “costly” masculine behaviors (risk-taking, costly status items) similarly likely sort individuals by underlying resource or health. Game models also explain honesty: if bluffing yields lower payoff (losing fights), only true strong males can dominate.

##### Ecological and Social Moderators

Ecology shapes display evolution. In environments with high predation, signals may be constrained unless offset by stronger sexual advantage. Operational sex ratio (ratio of sexually active males to females) impacts intensity: when male competition is fierce (male-biased ratio), displays and male risk-taking escalate. Social structure (polygynous vs monogamous) strongly predicts male trait exaggeration. Cooperative breeding species often show reduced male ornamentation since male–male competition is less intense.

### Conclusions and Future Directions

Male-typical displays are a pervasive feature of animal reproduction and competition, with clear analogies to human masculinity performance. **Overall, comparative data support the view that extravagant male displays evolve when they reliably convey quality or dominance and yield reproductive/competitive payoff**【25†L231-L239】【23†L291-L299】. The **strength of evidence is high** for the general pattern (meta-synthesis) but limited in establishing causality in specific human contexts. For humans, correlational studies show that masculinity threats link to compensatory aggression【26†L294-L302】【28†L307-L315】, but experimental field tests are needed.

**Empirical gaps**: We lack long-term multi-level studies linking individual hormone levels, situational triggers (e.g. humiliation), and subsequent behaviors in men. For animals, we need more cross-species phylogenetic comparisons of display cost-benefit trade-offs. Functional tests of signal honesty (e.g. handicapping experiments) are rare in the wild. 

**Future research** could include: 
- **Comparative hormonal manipulations**: Administering hormones or blockers to males in different species to test changes in display and mating success.
- **Ecological momentary assessment** of human testosterone and status stress in natural settings (e.g. sports games, debates).
- **Cross-cultural surveys** linking honor/face norms to public masculinity displays and aggression.
- **Field experiments on signaling**: altering male traits (e.g. brightening markings) and observing female choice or male response (ethical limits permitting). 
- **Phylogenetic comparative analyses** across birds/mammals to test theory predictions (e.g. testosterone–display correlations).

Ethical considerations are paramount, especially in human research (avoid inducing real harm, ensure informed consent). Human studies on aggression require debriefing and resources for participants. Cross-species field work must minimize disruption (e.g. playbacks at safe volumes).

In summary, male displays from peacock tails to human bravado share underlying selective logic. Combining ethological rigor with social-psychological insight illuminates the **continuities and divergences** in how males signal status and competence. This integrated perspective paves the way for coordinated empirical tests of “masculinity performance” in its biological and cultural contexts.
